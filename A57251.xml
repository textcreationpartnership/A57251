            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE OF THE PUBLISHER.</head>
            <p>THE very Name of Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> is enough to ſet a Value upon the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Letters that are here publiſhed. The leaſt Productions of ſo great a Man cannot but find an Univerſal Eſteem. This Illuſtrious Miniſter not only ſignaliz'd himſelf by his extraordinary Addreſs in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affairs, but reduc'd that difficult and myſterious Art into certain Maxims. He was not only acquainted with the moſt refin'd Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, but he likewiſe writ concerning them with a Penetration and Exactneſs that are admirable. His <hi>Politic Teſtament</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confirms the Truth of this Aſſertion. That incomparable Piece has been deſervedly looked upon as the beſt in its kind; and <note n="*" place="margin">In his Speech to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy.</note> Monſieur <hi>de la Bruyere,</hi> who, as he is one of the moſt profound Authors of this Age, is Maſter of the greateſt Politeneſs, thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oblig'd to take Notice of that everlaſting
<pb facs="tcp:42519:5"/>
Monument of his great, Abilities, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it as a Work that deſerves to live for ever.</p>
            <p>If theſe Praiſes are due to the <hi>Politic Teſtament</hi> of Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> as muſt be acknowledged on all hands, it may ſafely be affirm'd, that they belong as juſtly to the following Collection of Letters. We may in them diſcover the ſame Genius, and the ſame Solidity; with this difference however, that whereas in the above-mention'd Book, Matters of State are barely deliver'd in Rules and Precepts, we behold the Cardinal in theſe Letters, acting by thoſe Rules and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts upon all emergent Occaſions. Here we behold his incomparable Addreſs in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py managing of the niceſt and the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext Negotiations, his indefatigable Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his great Foreſight, which extended it ſelf as well to ſmall as to great Affairs; his prodigious Intrepidity, that engag'd him in the boldeſt Undertakings, which generally ſucceeded with mighty Glory to him. In ſhort, That Superiority of Genius, which eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him even above the Prince he ſerved, and made him formidable to the Grandees of his own Country; nay, to all the Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Letters are written upon different Subjects, and are addreſſed to ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; however, they all along preſerve the
<pb facs="tcp:42519:5"/>
Character which is ſuitable to them. That Simplicity of Style which is perpetually viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in them, is ſo far from being Diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to them, that it only makes them more grave, and more proper for the Perſon that compoſed them. Every one knows that it would look with a very ill Grace for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State to affect that ſcrupulous Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Politeneſs of Language in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches, which ſits well upon none but one that is a <hi>Bel-Eſprit</hi> by Profeſſion. Here the whole is accommodated to the Subject: The Reader will all along diſcover abundance of pretty Maxims, and judicious Reflexions; but they are every where imploy'd to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and without the leaſt Spice of Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Beſides theſe things, which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt ſufficient of themſelves to raiſe the Curioſity of the Reader, he will meet with a world of Remarkable Paſſages that fell out under the Reign of <hi>Lewis XIII.</hi> and are to be found no where elſe; I mean ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumſtances that have eſcaped the Diligence of the Hiſtorians of thoſe Times, and cou'd never have been known but for Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> or other Perſons that were actually in the Bottom of thoſe Affairs.</p>
            <p>Since the World receiv'd the Letters of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> ſo favourably, I may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Preſumption dare to ſay, That they will read theſe with greater Pleaſure and Profit;
<pb facs="tcp:42519:6"/>
for there is much more of Action, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Things, and a greater Variety of Matter, than the former do contain. The Reader need only compare theſe two Collections, to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the truth of what I have advanc'd.</p>

His Majeſty is reſolv'd at any rate to ridd himſelf of this Affair of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> provided his Honour will not ſuffer by it. As for my ſelf, I cannot ſufficiently admire how the Pope comes to ſtir himſelf no more in a Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch vaſt importance, not only to the Church, but to Chriſtendom in general. I am very well ſatisfy'd that the Intereſt of <hi>Urbin,</hi> where he apprehends the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> concern themſelves in favour of the Great Duke, makes him act with ſo much reſervation upon this occaſion. But then 'tis as plain, that there are other general Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, that more nearly regard the common Good of the Church, and conſequently that of the Holy Chair, which ought to incline his Holineſs to put an End to this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; it being certain that things are ſometimes carried farther than one cou'd have imagin'd at their firſt ſtarting up, and that if <hi>France</hi> engages her Word to other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States, that are willing to aſſiſt her in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, it will be no eaſie matter to bring her off again. I can aſſure you, his Majeſty is ſo ſtrict an Obſerver of his Word, that when he has once given his Promiſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World can induce him to violate it. From this Affair I paſs to the Diſpenſation for the Match with <hi>England,</hi> and muſt tell you, the King is extremely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at ſome Reports that come from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope will not allow it upon lower Terms than he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that with <hi>Spain:</hi> 'Tis enough, as I conceive, for the obtaining it, that the King ſhall procure ſuch Articles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> are neceſſary for the Salvation of the Princeſs, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42519:7"/>
all her Family, and that there be room to hope that the Catholicks of <hi>England</hi> will be gainers by the Marriage: Now the Affair is not only in this Condition, but we have procur'd more advantageous Terms, as <hi>Monſieur de Berule</hi> will inform you farther. Thus his Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done every thing for his Holineſs, that cou'd be expected from a Chriſtian Prince, and one of his known Piety, there is not the leaſt Appearance to believe he will receive any other Treatment but what he may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect. There is no neceſſity to ſtick to the Articles of <hi>Spain,</hi> but only to ſee whether thoſe of <hi>France</hi> are lawful and ſufficient. Now ſince they are really ſuch, what a Diſpleaſure will it be to his Majeſty, to receive a Refuſal, which may, perhaps, carry him to ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, that I wou'd not by my good Will, ſo much as think of. Not to inſiſt upon the Zeal I have for his Majeſty's Intereſts, I ſhou'd rather chuſe to ſuffer the ſevereſt Loſs, than that ever things ſhou'd run to ſuch a Criſis, which without doubt will prove prejudicial to the Church. I conjure you to repreſent at large to his Holineſs, all that has been hinted to you in this Letter, and to aſſure him, that as upon a Refuſal of the Diſpenſation, a World of Inconveniences will inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow, ſo that abundance of Good may be expected from his Holineſs's ſpeedy diſpatch of it. Pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to write to me, and I will take care to anſwer your Letters, and to make it appear upon all Occaſions, that I am,</p>

If his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Councel had been ſix Months ago ſuch as it is at preſent, we had taken wholſome Reſolutions here much earlier, and ſo Matters might have ended according to all our Deſires: But then it was impoſſible. What gives me the greateſt diſturbance is, that we looſe a ſine Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of advancing the Intereſts of Religion, all long of this unfortunate Affair, to which, I hope, Heaven will put a ſpeedy Concluſion.

               <p>THE King is extremely concern'd that he is not able to comply with all that the <hi>Sieur de Nardy</hi> demands in his Holineſs's Name. If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not a ſort of People that wou'd certainly take Advantage of every thing, the Requeſts of his Holineſs have always ſuch an Influence upon his Majeſty, that he wou'd freely grant them. If the Pope were inclin'd to diſpoſe of one part of <hi>France,</hi> he might do it without controul; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Deference to his Holineſs, and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which the King has for his Perſon, his Majeſty is oblig'd to manage himſelf with this caution in the Buſineſs of the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> I will not take upon me here to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with what, may and what may not be done, referring my ſelf as for that, to <hi>Monſieur d' Herbault;</hi> but this I will tell you, that the King, who for his part has no intentions to make War, does not think himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to a Ceſſation, and that he pays ſo profound a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Perſon of his Holineſs, that let this Matter be accommodated how it will, it will be much more agreeable to him, if 'tis done before him and by him, than if concluded in any other place, or by any other means whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The Advices you receiv'd about the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> are but too true. Thoſe People, inſtigated by the Devil, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as bad, have already begun to ſhew their ill In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, having enter'd the Port of <hi>Blavet</hi> by Surprize, and landed with ſome Peices of Canon, with which they batter'd the Fort two Days, and thought to carry it by Treachery, or by putting the Gariſon in a Fright. The King has already receiv'd the News, that the whole Province march'd to their Relief; upon which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my got aboard their Veſſels again, to ſave themſelves, but took away two or three Ships of <hi>Monſieur de Nevers,</hi> that were then in the Harbour. Theſe Attempts have been ſo far from hindering his Majeſty's Deſigns, that he has

already got together ſix Thouſand Men in <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and ſix Thouſand in <hi>Poictou,</hi> and reinforc'd the Armies of <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Picardy,</hi> with twelve Thouſand Men, and two thouſand Horſe; ſo that without any mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of Matters, the King pays at this preſent time ſixty Thouſand Effective Men in his own Kingdom, and ſix Thouſand Horſe.

I beg of Heaven that it will permit me to be ſo happy in this Deſign, that my Actions may ſignalize me much more than the Purple, with which you have been pleas'd to Honour me. Then, <hi>SIR,</hi> and not till then, the Satisfaction I begin now to receive, will become perfect; for the only Paſſion I have in the World, is by all imaginable Demonſtrations to convince you that I am,</p>

               <p>I Am ſenſible that as a Subject cannot, without a Crime, become troubleſome to his Prince, by making impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Demands, ſo he ought not to refuſe the Effects of his Liberality. Tho' I have hitherto preſerved my ſelf from the firſt of theſe Inconveniences, yet, to my great regret, I find my ſelf conſtrain'd to fall into the latter, humbly imploring your Majeſty not to be offended that I cannot accept of the two Abbies which you have been pleas'd to beſtow upon me. If I preſum'd to make this Supplication without Cauſe, I confeſs it wou'd be very cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal; but ſince 'tis grounded upon Reaſon, I'm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded you'll approve of it. Your Majeſty knows that both theſe places are become vacant by the Death of the <hi>Grand Prior.</hi> Now as I was a Member of your Council when the Intereſts of your State oblig'd you to cauſe his Perſon to be apprehended, I ſhou'd act directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my Conſcience, if I ſhou'd raiſe to my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Advantage by his Misfortune, or ſhare in his Spoils. I have already receiv'd ſeveral Marks of your Majeſty's Bounty; and ſince you have upon this occaſion declar'd your Inclinations of conferring others upon me, I can aſſure you that I will never be ſo ill advis'd as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them, if your Service does not oblige me to the contrary, as my own Sentiments do in this matter. I conjure you, <hi>SIR,</hi> to accept of theſe Conſiderations, and to reſt ſatisfy'd, that the only Intereſts I will cultivate, during the whole Courſe of my Life, ſhall be yours, and the Honour that may be acquir'd by ſerving ſo great a Prince.

               <p>THat your Majeſty might be fully inform'd of all the remarkable Occurrences that happen here, I have diſpatch'd this Bearer to you with all ſpeed, to acquaint you that five or ſix hundred Men, who had retir'd into the Fort of <hi>Thoulon,</hi> having ſurrender'd themſelves at Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to his Majeſty, the King was reſolv'd to have part of them hang'd, another ſent to the Gallies, and the leaſt guilty among them to be pardon'd. But ſo it fell out, that as the Guards were entring the above-mention'd Fort, to prevent any Diſorder, ſome <hi>Hugonots,</hi> more deſperate than their Fellows, and among the reſt one <hi>Chambelan</hi> of <hi>Privas,</hi> who had, as long as he was able, oppos'd their Surrendring at Diſcretion, by repreſenting to them, That ſuch People were generally hang'd for their pains; and that it was better to die by Fire, than by a Halter: <hi>I'll immediately,</hi> ſaid he, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Match in his Hand, <hi>ſet Fire to the Powder.</hi> And had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but was as good as his Word. The Fire deſtroy'd ſome of them; and others in the Fright threw themſelves from the Baſtion on which they ſtood, clearly out of the Fort, which was encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the whole Army; for we were forc'd to block up the place before they wou'd ſurrender: But the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers imagining that they had blown up the Guards, who it ſeems were upon a high Platform above this Baſtion, fell ſo outrageouſly upon theſe poor Men that leapt down, that they kill'd above two hundred of them, and that with ſuch Fury and Diſorder, that ſeveral of the Army were ſlain there, and ſome principal Officers had much ado to ſave themſelves. Dr. <hi>Mullot</hi> fancied he ſhou'd have been diſpatch'd thither as a Miniſter, but at preſent is more vexed at the Quality that has been given him, than at the Danger he underwent.</p>
               <p>It looks as if it were a particular Judgment of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this City, which has been always the Seat of Hereſie
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42519:13"/>
in theſe Quarters. At firſt it was not reſolv'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon it to Pillage, but at Night its Fate was decreed, ſo the Gates were left open, for the Soldiers to march in, and plunder it. All Endeavours were us'd to ſave it from being burnt, but in vain, for not one Houſe is left ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Town, but all bury'd in Aſhes. Nothing was omitted that might ſerve to preſerve thoſe that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd into the Fort of <hi>Toulon,</hi> from the Fury of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but they were conſtrain'd to expoſe themſelves to it, leaping down from their Fortifications, and giving the Soldiers an occaſion to exerciſe their Rage upon them with Fire, with which ſome deſperate Fellows a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, thought to have burnt themſelves with the King's People.</p>
               <p>Heaven was ſo kind to me, that I did not behold this cruel Scene; for the ſmall Fatigue I had undergone for about ſeven or eight Days, during the Siege, conſtrain'd me to keep my Bed that very Day, on which theſe Wretches were us'd in this manner.</p>
               <p>This involuntary Rigour which befel this City, and the Clemency that his Majeſty has ſhew'd towards thoſe places that ſurrendred freely, will convince the reſt how much they are oblig'd in Intereſt to make their Peace in time, and not ſtay till they are conſtrain'd to return to their Duty. And indeed in theſe Parts, four or five ſmall Cities, but well fortify'd, have already ſurrendred, <hi>viz. Baſtide, Vagnac, la Tour de Salvas,</hi> and <hi>Baulines. Chabrille</hi> is to wait upon the King to Morrow, and yield up to him all the ſmall Caſtles of <hi>Bouſſiers,</hi> and the <hi>Baulines,</hi> which were look'd upon to be the ſtrongeſt of the ſaid Places.</p>
               <p>On the Tenth Day after the Trenches were open, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas</hi> was taken, altho' the Fortifications of that Town were exceeding ſtrong.</p>
               <p>'Tis impoſſible to relate the ſeveral Cruelties which theſe Rebels have us'd towards the Catholicks. Among others, after the Siege was begun, they took the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the Capuchins of <hi>Valence,</hi> a Man of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Life, and ſingular Learning, and they treated him in ſo barbarous a manner, that they wou'd not kill him outright, till they had firſt cut off his Noſe, and pluck'd out his Eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. André,</hi> and Ten or Twelve of the principal Leaders, are taken Priſoners. Several are in the Hands of ſome Gentlemen of the Army, who will endeavour to ſave them, for the great Summs of Money they offer for their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42519:13"/>
Lives. Others have made their Eſcapes. And this, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> is an account of what has happen'd to <hi>Privas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King will not part theſe two or three Days from hence, becauſe he is oblig'd to ſtay till the Artilery comes up, which cannot be done ſo ſpeedily in ſuch an unpaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Country as this is. So ſoon as he has reſolv'd upon the Place where he is to go next, your Majeſty ſhall with all Expedition be inform'd of it. In the mean time I beg you'll do me the Honour to believe that no Man in the World is, or can be, with more Sincerity than I am,</p>

I can aſſure you that this happy Succeſs has but anſwered his Expectation, who always promis'd himſelf a Victory equal to what you have gain'd, from the Goodneſs of God, the Juſtice of his Cauſe, and from your Courage and Prudence. He has commanded a publick Thankſgiving to God, to whom we muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſo great and ſo conſiderable a Victory. The King does not queſtion but that you'll continue to act for his Service upon all Occaſions that ſhall preſent themſelves for the future, as well as you have hitherto done, which has given him all the Satisfaction imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as you'll find more particularly by his Diſpatches; to which referring my ſelf, I ſhall conclude this, with aſſuring you of the Continuance of my Affection, and that I am,</p>

               <p>I Have order'd the Abbot of <hi>Courſan,</hi> whom the King has ſent to the place where now you are, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Inſtructions intirely to you. Continue, I beſeech you, to manage Affairs ſo as may be moſt advantageous

to his Majeſty's Service. If we cou'd beat Duke <hi>Charles</hi> beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> or lock him up in ſome commodious Place, ſo that he cou'd not come back to the <hi>Franche-Comté,</hi> we might ſoon expect to ſee the happy effects of it, nor ſhou'd you be without a conſiderable ſhare in them. Let me prevail with you to continue in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my where you are, till ſuch time as you ſee what can be done againſt the aforeſaid Duke, with the Re-inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Sieur de Feuquieres,</hi> and that of <hi>Bellefonds.</hi> 'Tis of no ſmall importance to beat the Iron while 'tis hot upon this Occaſion, not only for the great Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the Enemy is in, but becauſe 'tis to be feared that Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> wont let you have the <hi>Germans</hi> long, but will call them home. If once Duke <hi>Charles</hi> were beaten, or retir'd beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> I wou'd deſire you to come hither with all ſpeed, that you might receive a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Poſt in the Army, whither I find your Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation carries you.</p>
               <p>While you tarry where you are, I conjure you not to expoſe your Perſon, as you have too often done. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me if I tell you, your Honour does not require, and the King's Service cannot ſuffer it. Beſides theſe Conſiderations, the Paſſion I have for you, as well as my own Intereſt, conſtrains me to tell you, that you cannot more ſenſibly oblige me, than by altering this Method.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Victory which it pleaſed God to give the King in <hi>Flanders,</hi> may poſſibly have arriv'd to you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by common Report, yet I thought my ſelf oblig'd to communicate this good News to you, knowing what an extraordinary Joy it will give you, as well for the Reputation that his Majeſty, as for the Glory that your Friends have acquir'd by it.</p>
               <p>Above five thouſand of the Enemy fell upon the place, fifteen hundred were wounded, and thirteen hundred taken Priſoners, among whom is the Count <hi>de la Feire,</hi> Governour of the Citadel of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> and Lieutenant-General of the Army; <hi>Don Alonce Ladron, Meſtre de Camp</hi> of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Regiment; <hi>Sfondrate, Meſtre de Camp</hi> of an <hi>Italian</hi> Regiment; the Count de <hi>Willerval;</hi> and ſeveral others of Quality, with a great number of Officers: They have loſt ſixteen Pieces of Cannon, which is all they had; and all their Baggage; which is ſo much the more conſiderable, becauſe, as 'tis ſaid, there were two Waggons full of Money, fifty or ſixty Colours or Flags. There goes a flying Report, that Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> is ſlain,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42519:18"/>
and the Count <hi>d Bucquoy</hi> wounded in this Action; but this wants a farther Confirmation.</p>
               <p>The King has not loſt above fifty Men in this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, among whom there is but one Captain, and ſome other Officers; and an hundred and fifty wounded; which renders this Victory the more compleat.</p>
               <p>The Army of the Enemies was compos'd of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten Regiments of Foot, and fifty Troops of Horſe, that were the beſt they had.</p>
               <p>This is all I had to communicate to you in this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, referring my ſelf for the reſt to the Abbot of <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> who will aſſure you that his Majeſty is in good Health, and that I am with all imaginable ſincerity,</p>

For I don't think it by any means adviſeable for you to take the Towns, Villages, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unfortify'd places that lie near you; ſince beſides that 'tis impoſſible to keep them, ſuch a Procedure wou'd oblige the Enemies to retaliate the ſame upon us, and ſo fatigue our Troops, that in caſe any important Action ſhou'd happen, we ſhou'd certainly come by the worſt of it.

               <p>LOng before I receiv'd your Letter, wherein you give me an account of the Battel between our and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, I had rejoyc'd with you and <hi>Monſieur de Brezé,</hi> for the Victory which God was pleas'd to give his Majeſty upon this Occaſion, not only for the Glory and Reputation which <hi>France</hi> will derive from this good Succeſs, but likewiſe for the Honour you have hereby acquir'd, the increaſe of which I no leſs paſſionately deſire, than your ſelf can do. It lies in your Power ſtill to draw the beſt Advantages from ſo glorious a Victory; but you need not be reminded of doing that, for I doubt not but that every thing will be perform'd, which your Prince may expect from your Prudence, from your Affection, and good Conduct. One of the moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means, in my Opinion, to bring this about to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his Majeſty's Affairs, will be for <hi>Monſieur de Brezé</hi> and you to live in ſo perfect an Union and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that nothing may be ever able to alter it. Beſides the Service of the King, who requires you to keep a good underſtanding among your ſelves, you will alſo anſwer my Prayers, who deſire the ſame of you; and indeed 'tis ſo viſibly the Intereſt of you both to live after this manner, that I am ſatisfy'd neither of you will omit any thing that may contribute to ſo good an End.

They likewiſe make mention that you and <hi>Monſieur de Brezé</hi> have refus'd to take Orders from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> which I cannot believe, ſince 'tis one of the Articles agreed upon in our Treaty.

               <p>J Am extremely pleas'd with your giving <hi>Galaſſe</hi> the ſlip, as well becauſe 'tis for the King's Service, as for your own Glory in particular. I hope from your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct all that may be expected from a Perſon who has Zeal and Application joyn'd to his great Abilities; and I promiſe you that nothing in my power ſhall be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to make the King's Armies under your Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leave off their old Licentious Habitudes, and be brought under good Diſcipline, as they ought to be. To effect this, great Vigour muſt be ſhewn on your part, it being utterly impoſſible without that to bring Matters to ſuch a paſs, as you and I deſire they ſhou'd be, for our Prince's Service. You will find by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Puniſhment which his Majeſty inflicted on a hundred and fifty Officers that abſented themſelves from the Army in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that there is no other way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy Diſorders but this. This Severity will moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly be continu'd, and indeed without it all will be loſt. In the Name of God, never pardon any of your Deſerters, but make remarkable Examples of them. One ſingle Inſtance will make you dreaded as long as you live, and put you in a way to be thought Merciful ever after.</p>
               <p>I have already ſent you Word, that for the future you ſhall be abundantly ſupply'd with Bread. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of that, I promiſe you that <hi>Nancy</hi> and <hi>Metz</hi> ſhall never be without ſufficient Magazines.</p>
               <p>As our Forces encreaſe every day, it will be much eaſier to make ſuch good proviſion for our Convoys, of Corn, and other Neceſſaries, that our Carriages may be no longer incommoded.</p>
               <p>Our four thouſand Dragoons are arrived, beſides 1700 more that are to be ſent to you, and a thouſand to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de la Force.</hi> Five hundred of them are quarter'd at <hi>Toul,</hi> to ſecure the above-mention'd Carriages, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42519:21"/>
five hundred in other places, that were judg'd the moſt important.</p>
               <p>If you have occaſion for no more Troops than what you have already with you, which I cannot believe, conſidering what a neceſſity you have for Proviſions, we are of opinion that out of the remainder of thoſe that are deſign'd for you, a ſmall Body ſhou'd be form'd at <hi>Metz,</hi> to clear all thoſe places that annoy your Carriages, and particularly <hi>Cirk.</hi> For this end <hi>Bellefonds</hi> is ſent to <hi>Metz,</hi> to receive two or three Regiments that you want, and all the Dragoons that are deſign'd for you, as alſo <hi>Canillas,</hi> who is in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the remainder of the Horſe, which you are to have, that with theſe Forces he may poſſeſs himſelf of that troubleſome place, that has ſo long incommoded you. If you believe that ſome other Deſign may turn to better Account, 'tis but ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word to the above-mention'd <hi>Sieur de Bellefonds,</hi> and he will follow your Orders.</p>
               <p>On the Twentieth of this Month, the <hi>Meſſieurs de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouleſme</hi> and <hi>de la Force</hi> will be reinforc'd with <hi>Matig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe, and above 2500 Gentlemen. Beſides this, we ſhall have at <hi>Langres,</hi> a Body of eight hundred Horſe, and a thouſand Dragoons, to hinder the Enemy's Inſults on that ſide. The Levies of the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> are compleated. We are raiſing twenty Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and four thouſand Horſe, as I have ſent you Word already; and beſides this, we are going to raiſe two thouſand Horſe of new Cavalry, which you writ to me about, that will only carry a Cuiraſs, a Helmet to cover the Cheeks and Noſe, a Carabine, and a Piſtol; and I believe we ſhall call them the <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Cavalry, unleſs <hi>Monſieur Hebron</hi> gives us a better Name. There is no queſtion but we ſhall have Forces enough; all the difficulty will be to employ them well. Endeavours will be us'd on one ſide, to beat back the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> As for you, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I don't doubt but you will do what impoſſible. The King has not order'd what you are to do, but has that good Opinion of your Prudence and Conduct, that he leaves you to act at your own Diſcretion; for he knows you will weigh every thing deliberately, before you take the laſt Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur Servien</hi> has ſent you a very large Letter, which will excuſe me from running into farther Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.

I can aſſure you, that not one has parted from this place, but I did my ſelf the honour to write to you by him. I cannot tell whether I muſt lay the blame upon them, or the Secretaries of State, to whom for the moſt part I give my Letters. All imaginable Care has been taken here, to reinforce your Troops; but the Enemy is ſo conſiderably increas'd on the ſide of the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> that having form'd two conſiderable Bodies, one of which being commanded by <hi>Leinon,</hi> they have thrown into S. <hi>Michel,</hi> and other places near you, it was judged neceſſary to employ part of the Re-inforcement deſign'd for your ſelf, to compoſe a ſecond Body, in order to go and meet with <hi>Leinon.</hi> So ſoon as they have either routed, or driven him back, you ſhall be recruited with a Dozen Troops of Horſe, and a Thouſand Dragoons.</p>
               <p>Five Regiments likewiſe will be ſent to <hi>Metz,</hi> to ſtrengthen you; but becauſe they are new-rais'd Men, and 'tis to be fear'd that the greateſt part of them will Deſert, I leave it to your Conſideration whether it will be the beſt way to make them march as far as your Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or rather to keep them at <hi>Metz,</hi> to be employ'd in caſe of neceſſity, with ſix thouſand <hi>Switzers,</hi> that are to keep the Field.</p>

               <p>The hearty Zeal which you expreſs for the King's Service, and the great Judgment which God has given you, will ſo well direct you to chooſe what will be moſt advantageous to us in the preſent Occaſions, that I think it not neceſſary to ſpend any more Words upon an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument you are ſo well acquainted with. However, if you pleaſe to inform me what Meaſures you deſign to take, I will ſoon let you know my Sentiments of them.</p>
               <p>Great Affairs are always attended with great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but with God's aſſiſtance, we'll keep up our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſtill. Every thing goes well in <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</hi> One lucky hit againſt Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> where we might have done much greater Matters than we have, wou'd have placed us above the feeble Efforts of our Adverſaries. I hope we ſhall manage Matters on that ſide with more Succeſs for the future, than hitherto we have found. I am ſatisfy'd that for your Part, you will continue to act as you have begun, that is to ſay, as well as 'tis poſſible for a Man to behave himſelf, or for us to wiſh.</p>
               <p>Pray let me know after what manner you liv'd with the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy.</hi> There were ſome at <hi>Rome</hi> that gave him the Title of Highneſs; and there were others that deny'd it. He deſir'd that my Brother wou'd give him that Title, but anſwer was made, that he wou'd live with him as he had done for the time paſt, and after your Example. For this reaſon I long to know
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42519:26"/>
after what manner you treated him, and hope you'll do me the Honour to ſatisfie me about it. I am till Death,</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Sieur Ferrier</hi> is gone to wait upon you with a Month's Pay for the Cavalry of your Army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which you lately made. We do every thing in the World here to ſupport you, provided you cou'd but make an Advantage of it, as you deſire, but the lazineſs and inconſtancy of the <hi>French</hi> is ſuch, that a Man can promiſe no mighty Matters from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur de Bullion</hi> ſends you thirty thouſand Livres, that you may have a particular Fund to ſerve you upon all Emergencies, and yet not be oblig'd to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how 'tis expended, to any one.</p>
               <p>I thank you for the great care you have taken of my Companies. I have ſent the <hi>Sieur de Biſcaras</hi> to them, who receiv'd two thouſand Crowns of me; one half of which is to be diſtributed among my Troop of Light-Horſe, and the other among that of the <hi>Gendarms,</hi> by the <hi>Sieur de Locmaria.</hi> I have been this long while enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for ſome experienc'd Officers to place at the Head of them, which has given me ſome trouble; but I hope now to find ſuch as will be proper for my purpoſe, and then I will put all in good order without delay.</p>
               <p>I have a Company here at hand, which the King gave me leave to raiſe by the <hi>Sieur de Potiniere,</hi> whom I order'd about two Days ago, to march directly towards your
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42519:26"/>
Quarters, that you might have no reaſon to complain of the Diminution of my Companies. However, if you find them in ſuch a Condition, that part of them will ſerve you turn, your may diſpoſe of them as you ſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sieur Ponica</hi> is arriv'd, but I have not ſeen him yet: We will treat with him the moſt advantageouſly for our ſelves, that we can. 'Tis certain that ſome <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Horſe will be neceſſary for us; but the difficulty will be where to get them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur Bouthilliers</hi> has ſent me an account what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints you make of <hi>Bellefonds:</hi> No doubt but the King will give you all the Satisfaction you can expect in that Matter.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry to find by you, that the King's Companies are in ſuch ill Order. At the ſame time I am pleaſed that you are ſo well ſatisfy'd with the Regiment of Guards, and with the News you ſent me about the <hi>Sieur Savignac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am likewiſe well pleaſed to hear what <hi>Monſieur de Turenne</hi> has perform'd, in relation to the Caſtles which he took by your Order. I don't queſtion but he will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his great Merits upon all occaſions.</p>
               <p>Don't be afraid, I beg it of you, to be too ſevere, for 'tis almoſt impoſſible for you to treſpaſs in that kind. The King's Affairs are in ſo perplexed a Condition, that 'tis a Chimoera to go to rectifie them without Rigour. I deſire you to ſend me good verbal Proceſſes againſt all thoſe that have abandon'd the Army, that I may ſee them accordingly puniſh'd. If you condemn <hi>Vezilly,</hi> as you ſend me word you will, I'll take care to have your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence put in execution. The <hi>Sieur Ferrier</hi> will entertain you ſo particularly about all that has happen'd here, that at preſent I need only ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

'Tis certain that as one unfortunate Event wou'd throw our Affairs into a great Diſorder, ſo a compleat Victory wou'd be of mighty advantage to us: And ſo much do I relie upon your Courage, your Prudence, your Zeal for the Service of the King, and your generous Ambition to anſwer the expectation of your Friends, that I promiſe my ſelf every thing from your Conduct. We have put up publick Supplications to God in all the Convents of <hi>Paris,</hi> to implore a Bleſſing upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Arms.

His Majeſty has ſent the Count <hi>de Gramail</hi> to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> becauſe he was one of thoſe who inſtead of advancing his Affairs, was a means of keeping them back. There are abundance of other ill-favour'd Particulars, that I cannot ſend you an account of now, but we will diſcourſe of them ſometime or other at your leaſure.

               <p>I am clearly of opinion, that you cannot make too much haſte to ſummon the Nobility of the Country, and the Companies of <hi>Gendarms</hi> belonging to you and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur d' Ambres,</hi> to appear.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have again diſpatch'd the <hi>Sieur de Rentiere</hi> to you with all ſpeed, to acquaint you that we have ſeized a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> directed to the <hi>Cardinal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,</hi> wherein he tells him in expreſs Terms, that were it not for the War of <hi>Italy,</hi> he had before this made a Deſcent upon <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and that he employs all his Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to carry on that Deſign. Beſides theſe general Terms, when he comes to Particulars, he plainly ſays that he is reſolv'd to ſurprize <hi>Mazeres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prevent this Deſign, you are order'd immediately upon the receipt of this, to put the two Regiments on foot for which you have receiv'd Commiſſions, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money is ſent to you to defray your Charges in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them; and ſince the Paſſes of <hi>Col Saint-Louis,</hi> and <hi>Col de Terneres</hi> are the only two places through which they Enemy can come towards <hi>Mazeres</hi> and <hi>Saverdan,</hi> you muſt diſpatch ſome Forces with all expedition to ſeize and fortifie them.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe 'tis impoſſible to keep <hi>Col de Terneres</hi> any other way but by fortifying <hi>Forcereal</hi> in the Enemy's Country, and <hi>Col de las-Batailles</hi> in ours, you muſt ſeize the above-mention'd <hi>Col de las-Batailles,</hi> and fortifie it; and the King will impower you to ſurprize <hi>Forcereal,</hi> and fortifie it, provided you are able to keep it, as the <hi>Sieur de Rentiere</hi> propoſes it feaſible.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty likewiſe gives you power to poſſeſs your ſelf of <hi>Aupoulx;</hi> which place the aforeſaid <hi>Sieur de Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiere</hi> tells us, may be eaſily gain'd; and when once in our Poſſeſſion, ſo eaſie to be kept, that 'tis impoſſible for all the Force of <hi>Spain</hi> to wreſt it out of our Hands.</p>
               <p>I am apt to believe that theſe two Deſigns cannot well miſcarry, provided they are put in execution with ſpeed and ſecreſie. Beſides the <hi>Sieur de Rentiere,</hi> whom we have truſted with this Matter, no Man living has the leaſt knowledge of it; and in the Country it will
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42519:28"/>
be eaſie enough to keep it ſecret, by pretending that all theſe Preparations you make are for the Defence and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of your Frontier, which the Enemy has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly threaten'd to attack.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Mazeres,</hi> when you are upon the Spot, you'll be able to judge whether it will be more expedient to put that place in a poſture of Defence againſt an Army that can come none of the ſtrongeſt out of <hi>Spain,</hi> or to raze it more than it is at preſent.</p>
               <p>My Opinion is, that it will be our beſt way to guard the Paſſes thro' which the Enemy muſt march to viſit us, and publickly to take notice that we are inform'd of their Deſigns. Upon this, in all probability, they will not attempt to put them in execution; or if they ſhou'd, the Paſſes being ſufficiently guarded, and the Country in Arms, they muſt unavoidably fail in their Undertaking.</p>
               <p>However, if you ſhou'd not think this ſufficient, omit nothing that you believe may be ſerviceable to your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and for that effect, viſit all places in Perſon. To execute what has been hinted to you above, you'll have four Regiments, two of which are on foot already, and t'other two muſt be rais'd with all imaginable diligence; beſides your Company of <hi>Gendarms,</hi> that of Light-Horſe of the <hi>Sieur de Merinville,</hi> that of the <hi>Gendarms</hi> of <hi>Monſieur d'Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi> which muſt ſpeedily be equipp'd, and the two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Carabine-Cuiraſſiers, which you may likewiſe raiſe in a ſhort time; and ſo ſoon as you ſend us word that they are raiſed, care ſhall be taken to ſend you a Fund to pay for the raiſing of them. As for Subſiſtence, you muſt find ſome way or other to make them live upon the Frontier; which will be no difficult matter to do when <hi>Forecereal</hi> is once in your Hands, ſince there are abundance of fertile Vallies all about it.</p>
               <p>'Tis your buſineſs to take care to put into all your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, that you think worth the keeping, Men of Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Capacity to defend them, otherwiſe you'll have the Mortification to ſee your Endeavours blaſted. Leave nothing unattempted that will contribute to carry on this Deſign, that ſo the King may receive that Satisfaction from it which he expects, and your ſelf the Honour which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you may find; as being with all ſincerity,</p>

               <p>THE King ſending into <hi>Languedoc</hi> the <hi>Baron de Meſlé</hi> and <hi>d'Agencourt,</hi> to whoſe Merit you are no Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; the firſt of whom is to aſſiſt and adviſe you in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Occaſions, and to ſerve under you in the Quality of <hi>Mareſchal de Camp;</hi> and the ſecond, to view the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the chief places in your Government, and to confer with you about all ſuch Matters as may be done for the Advantage of his Majeſty's Service, and to ſerve in quality of <hi>Sergeant de Bataille;</hi> I thought my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ſend you advice of it by this Letter, that you might know what care his Majeſty takes of all Affairs in your Quarters. They have both promis'd me to make all the haſte they can, and as they have marked out their Stages, I believe they will be with you in fifteen Days at moſt. I have communicated to the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd <hi>Sieur d'Argencourt,</hi> in whom I repoſe an intire Confidence, the Deſign you ſaw in the Diſpatch which I ſent to you by the <hi>Sieur de Rentiere,</hi> the Summ and Subſtance of which is, to ſeize with all ſpeed the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Col de Saint-Loüis,</hi> and <hi>Col de Terneres,</hi> which are the only places through which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> can come to attempt any thing upon us on the ſide of <hi>Mazeres,</hi> upon which they have a Deſign, as I have already inform'd you, and to get Poſſeſſion of <hi>Force real</hi> and <hi>Col de las-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailles;</hi> which the aforeſaid <hi>Sieur de Rentiere</hi> propoſes as very feaſible. So ſoon as he is arriv'd, you may examine every particular along with him, if you never gave your ſelf the trouble to do it before. As there is a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between attempting upon an Enemy in his own Country, and barely hindering him from doing any thing in ours, by guarding the Paſſes through which they muſt march to annoy us, it concerns your Prudence to conſider well what you undertake, to hazard nothing unadviſedly, and purſue no Deſigns but ſuch as promiſe an infallible Succeſs, and which you are able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42519:29"/>
One of the principal things, in my opinion, which you have to do, is to be provided with good Spies, and to be faithfully inform'd from time to time, of the Countenance of your Enemies, and the number of their Troops, becauſe upon theſe you may form your Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and advance or retard the execution of them as you ſhall ſee convenient.</p>
               <p>If you are inform'd that they are not in a condition to attack you, or that they have other Deſigns, you may for ſome time defer the Execution of your Enterprizes, and in the mean time cauſe the two new Regiments, and the Horſe, for which you have already receiv'd Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to be raiſed, that you may make your ſelf more ſtrong and conſiderable. But if you receive advice, that they are both able and willing to diſpute it with you, you muſt take care to be before-hand with them, as well as your Forces will give you leave, without ſtaying till your new Levies are got ready. After all, they can never hinder you from poſſeſſing your ſelf of the Paſſes through which they muſt march with their Equipage into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> nor from keeping them ſtill in your Hands, ſince you have the whole Country behind you open and free, which will furniſh you abundantly with all Proviſions. This is what I had to offer to you in this Letter, which I ſhall conclude, by aſſuring you of the Continuance of my Affection, and that I am with all ſincerity,</p>

There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expedient, which is to reduce the broken Regiments to two or three Companies each, according as they have more or leſs Men in them, and to keep them in indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Companies, to beſtow them in the ſtrong Places and Caſtles of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> where any Garriſons are to be left, that the ſeveral Regiments of which the Army is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, may not be divided for the time to come. The chief matter will be to find good Officers, that will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the places where you poſt them, and not to fill them up with Fellows that have neither Wit nor Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as it has been the way hitherto. I look upon this laſt Expedient to be better than the firſt. I deſire you to make an Experiment of it ſpeedily, before the return of this Bearer, whom we have on purpoſe diſpatch'd to you, and to ſend us word by him what you have done.</p>
               <p>As for the Cavalry, 'tis his Majeſty's Intention that the Troops of <hi>Bouquinville, Sancourt, Choiſy,</hi> and <hi>Buſſy-de-Veyre,</hi> ſhou'd continue broken, except thoſe that are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to mount again, and enter into Pay. You may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with it, that if they keep to this Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they may have time enough to prepare themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42519:30"/>
               <p>I have already conjur'd you to ſend me a Copy of the Judgments you have paſſed againſt the Deſerters of your Army; I beg the favour once more of you to do it, ſince 'tis of the laſt importance to the King's Service, to make Examples of ſuch People. His Majeſty has granted to the Officers of the Companies of Light-Horſe, the Confiſcation of thoſe that have abandon'd them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave. This will certainly oblige them to take more care for the future, to ſee them puniſh'd, and cauſe thoſe Sentences to be executed that are paſſed againſt them.</p>
               <p>I don't find there's any great probability of keeping on foot under the Title of a Regiment, that of <hi>Orelio,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which you writ to me, it being reduc'd to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or ſixſcore Men at the moſt. All that can be done, in my Opinion, is to reduce it to a free Independant-Company, where all the Soldiers that are left, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently diſpos'd of.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any more likelyhood that the Troops of <hi>Saint-Remy</hi> will be kept up, under the Name of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince I can't ſee how 'tis poſſible for them to get again into <hi>Liege.</hi> The beſt thing that can be done for them, will be to reduce them to a Company of Light-Horſe, under the ſame Pay with the reſt of the Army.</p>
               <p>I conjure you to diſpatch without delay, the Officers that are nam'd by each Body of your Army, to gather Recruits, to come and receive their Money at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that afterwards they go about that Affair with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expedition, becauſe they have no time now to loſe. In the mean while be aſſured, that I am, and will be for ever,</p>

But above all, take ſpecial care that as you have poſſeſſed and fortify'd the principal Paſſes, by which the Enemy can march to you, you don't let them come and attack you in others which you have not provided for; by which means they may force you to act on the defenſive. As I promiſe my ſelf no leſs from your Prudence than from your Courage, I am confident you will hazard nothing but where you have a very fair proſpect of ſucceeding. For as in this caſe, a Diverſion wou'd be very uſeful to us, if the Enemy attacked us powerfully in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> ſo otherwiſe it wou'd exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly prejudice his Majeſty's Affairs.

I will only tell you, that this good Succeſs did not deceive my Expectation, and that I always promiſed my ſelf as much from your Zeal to the King, and from your Prudence and good Conduct. I ſay nothing to you concerning the Relief of <hi>Haguenau,</hi> becauſe I am ſatisfy'd that if the thing is practicable, you will loſe no Time nor Opportunity to effect it, and that you will undertake nothing but upon very good Grounds. I am ſorry to find in your Letter that you are in ſuch want of Money. I will employ all my Intereſt with the Superintendants to furniſh you as ſoon as poſſible. In the mean time, don't be afraid to draw Bills of Exchange upon them, as often as you have occaſion, to ſubſiſt your Troops, and to buy Corn, and other Proviſions, which you may throw into <hi>Haguenau,</hi> and other places, upon the aſſurance I give you, that they ſhall pay your Bills without the leaſt difficulty.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion, it will be convenient not only to put the Governour of <hi>Benfield</hi> in hopes of receiving a Penſion from the King, but likewiſe poſitively to aſſure him of it. You may relie upon me that it ſhall be paid him without Contradiction. I will not preſcribe the particular Summ, but leave that wholly to your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion. <hi>Monſieur de Chavigny</hi> has ſent you ſo large an Account of all that has happen'd in theſe parts, that nothing remains for me, but to conjure you to reſt aſſured, that no Man loves you better than my ſelf,

The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution which the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> has taken up to follow you near at hand, will, in my opinion, not a little facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the execution of your Deſign, eſpecially if he poſts himſelf in a place from whence he may readily joyn his Troops with yours, according to his Promiſe, whenever you have any occaſion for them. For my part, I don't queſtion but that he'll do all that lies in his power, to put himſelf in a condition to do us good Service.</p>
               <p>The King is very well pleas'd with the Order you have given to <hi>Monſieur de Mande,</hi> to furniſh his Troops with Corn, judging well that without this Proviſion, it wou'd be impoſſible for them to ſubſiſt, ſince the Country is intirely laid waſte.

I don't doubt but you'll husband the Money as well as you can, and wait the Harveſt which is now near at hand, when you may buy it at a cheap rate, eſpecially if the Soldiers will be got to work, when they have no Enemies to diſturb them.</p>
               <p>You will not take it ill, I am confident, that I have ſent back my Company to you, which has already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves very well under your Command, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ten out of my Regiment, and others. I thought fit to re-inforce you with theſe Men, that you may employ them upon all occurrences, where you have occaſion for them.</p>
               <p>Having receiv'd advice that the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Croats</hi> had croſſed over to <hi>Thionville,</hi> to joyn <hi>Galaſſe,</hi> Orders were immediately diſpatch'd to <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince, to ſend fifteen hundred Horſe to <hi>Enchiſſen,</hi> to joyn you, that you might be in a condition to do ſomething conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
               <p>The King has granted to Colonel <hi>Hebron</hi> the ranſom of <hi>Meternick,</hi> and precedence to his Regiment before all the new ones of twenty Companies, that have been created ſince him.</p>
               <p>I deſire you to manage with good husbandry the forty thouſand Crowns I have ſent you to lay out in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42519:35"/>
buying of Corn; ſo that with the Harveſt, you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, without any other Coſt but that of cutting it, the Garriſons may be provided for two or three Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand; and if 'tis practicable, make the Governours give you a Certificate of the Corn which they have in their Towns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur de Noyers</hi> will ſollicit for a Month's Pay, which you writ to me about, that it may be ſent to you in time.</p>
               <p>I am concerned that the fifteen hundred Horſe which we ſent to you for the <hi>Franche-Comté,</hi> are not yet arriv'd; for I am of opinion, that you'll have an opportunity to do ſomething worthy of your ſelf this Summer.</p>

               <p>I Can't expreſs to you my great concern for the Death of poor Colonel <hi>Hebron,</hi> not only for the eſteem I had of his Perſon, but for the Affection and Zeal he always teſtify'd for his Majeſty's Service. His Loſs has touch'd me in ſo lively and ſenſible a manner, that 'tis impoſſble for me to receive any Comfort. I don't queſtion what you tell me in your Letter, that it has afflicted your ſelf in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; for to ſay the Truth, he was a Gentleman that was very neceſſary to us at this Juncture. I have paid to his Memory all that lay in my power, to expreſs my great value for him, ordering Prayers to be made to God for him, and aſſiſting his Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hew with what he has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for, as if he were my own Relation. The Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of <hi>Maternic</hi> is ſecur'd for him, and whatever is due to his Unkle, ſhall moſt punctually be paid to him. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne</hi> coſts us exceeding dear, but we muſt patiently bear what pleaſes God.</p>
               <p>We find it a matter of great perplexity upon whom to beſtow the aforeſaid Colonel's Regiment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his eldeſt Captain, who is related to him, is a <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi> and the Catholicks earneſtly petition to have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon one of their Party; among whom we find the <hi>Sieur Douglaſs,</hi> who is deſcended from one of the beſt Families in <hi>Scotland.</hi> In the mean time, nothing ſhall be reſolv'd upon here, relating to this occaſion, till we have receiv'd Advice from you, which we deſire you to ſend by the firſt opportunity.</p>
               <p>We have another Difficulty too upon our Hands, that gives us no leſs trouble, and that is, to find out for you a proper <hi>Mareſchall de Camp,</hi> ſuch a one as you want. The King willingly conſents that you have <hi>Monſieur de Buſſy;</hi> but him you cannot have ſoon enough. As for <hi>Monſieur de Rambure,</hi> he is ſufficiently taken up with the buſineſs of his Place. So we have ſent to you the <hi>Grand Provoſt</hi> in in this Quality, who is a Gentleman of very good Senſe,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42519:36"/>
great Courage, and ſweetneſs of Temper. He will get together the Recruits of Foot and Horſe that are in <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> to aid you to make ſome oppoſition to <hi>Offlans,</hi> who lies quarter'd on that ſide, with about ſome twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſorry Horſe.</p>
               <p>The King gives his conſent that <hi>Saverne</hi> be put into the hands of the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> provided he gives his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in Writing, to leave the Exerciſe of the Catholick Religion in that place, ſuch as he finds it, without the leaſt alteration. Altho' you are deliver'd from the fears of that Siege, it will concern you and the Duke to follow the moſt advantageous meaſures you can for the King's Service. If <hi>Galaſſe</hi> ſhou'd poſt himſelf any where, where you might have ſome notable Advantage over him, it wou'd be a great Blow; but I can ſcarce bring my ſelf to believe any ſuch thing can be done, till <hi>Dole</hi> is taken, which will happen, with God's aſſiſtance, according to your advices, by the end of this Month. You muſt take care that nothing incommode you in the <hi>Franche-Comté,</hi> but eſpecially favour the Harveſt in <hi>Alſatia.</hi> For the reſt, his Majeſty leaves you at full liberty, to take ſuch Methods as you ſhall judge to be moſt expedient. If you pleaſe to acquaint us with them, we ſhall ſend you our Thoughts, without obliging you to follow them, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering you to execute what you ſhall think proper, till you have receiv'd our Anſwer.</p>
               <p>After the Siege of <hi>Dole</hi> is over, and the King Maſter of the place, we will ſee what a Re-inforcement we can then ſend you; the preſent Poſture of Affairs in theſe Parts not permitting us as yet to part with any of our Troops. We are providing to ſend you the ſecond Months Pay, which you ſollicit for, and that you may ſuffer no Diſappointments of that nature, it ſhall be ſent away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the third or fourth of the next Month.</p>
               <p>The Enemy have taken <hi>Capelle</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Picardy,</hi> becauſe the Place made no manner of defence. We know the reaſons that the Governour will alledge in his own Juſtification; but he has utterly forfeited the Expectation which the World had conceiv'd of him. As this is but a very ſmall place, and of little importance, the loſs of it is not conſiderable. Therefore let not this Matter give you any Pain at all, for I can aſſure you, that the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we have in theſe parts, are more than ſufficient, not only to hinder our Enemies from doing us any miſchief, but likewiſe to take our Revenge upon them, if a fit Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42519:36"/>
preſents it ſelf. The King will not change his Deſigns of making the Army of the <hi>Franche-Comté</hi> act in theſe Quarters, but not yours, or that of the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> purſuant to the firſt Reſolutions that were taken in theſe Matters. Only perhaps a thouſand Horſe may be order'd to come from the Army in <hi>Burgundy</hi> into <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi> as ſoon as <hi>Dole</hi> is taken, that we may be in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition to oppoſe the Enemy, whoſe greateſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts ſeems to be upon the Frontiers of <hi>Picardy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot conclude this Letter, without teſtifying to you once more my great regret for <hi>Monſieur Hebron.</hi> I am likewiſe ſorry to hear that <hi>Monſieur de Turenne</hi> is wounded.

               <p>I Have receiv'd your Letter which you were pleaſed to write to me upon the occaſion of the taking of <hi>Saverne,</hi> and have conſider'd the Contents of it. We ſhou'd be willing to put that place into the Hands of the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> to teſtifie the great Confidence we repoſe in him, But certain it is, that the Catholicks wou'd lay hold of ſuch an Opportunity, to raiſe great Clamours againſt us, this place being the Seat of the Biſhop of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> whither the Catholicks have retir'd. The Nuncio has already inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very particularly how we deſign to diſpoſe of it; and his Holineſs, whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> perpetually inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate againſt <hi>France,</hi> as you know well enough, wou'd carry himſelf wholly againſt us upon this occaſion. Pray give the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> to underſtand ſo much; and to convince him how much we relie upon his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42519:37"/>
and that no other reaſon in the World ſhou'd hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King from delivering the place up to him, his Majeſty is content, if he deſires it, that you ſhou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Caſtle of <hi>Aubar</hi> to him; and if he takes any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> or upon the <hi>Sarre,</hi> which he thinks worthy of Conſideration, the King is well ſatisfy'd that it ſhou'd be conſign'd over to him. This, <hi>My Lord,</hi> is all that we have to ſay upon this Subject, his Majeſty refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reſt to your Prudence.</p>
               <p>As for the reſt, when ever the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> thinks fit to make any ſtay in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> the King is well enough content it ſhou'd be at <hi>Saverne,</hi> provided he likes the place, and will give Orders to thoſe that he puts into the place, to receive him with as much Honour and Deference, as if the aforeſaid place were abſolutely in his Hands.</p>
               <p>You muſt remember to chuſe a Governour for it, of a different Temper from the Wretch that had it laſt, that if it happens to be attack'd, he may follow the Example of thoſe that defended and acquired it with ſo great Trouble and Expence, ſince poor Colonel <hi>Hebron</hi> died there.</p>
               <p>It belongs to your Diſcretion to conſider whether you cannot re-inforce the <hi>Grand Provoſt</hi> with ſome Troops in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to make oppoſition againſt the Enemy that is there, which is conformable to a Deſign I have ſeen in a Letter of the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> by approaching near the <hi>Sarre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude; the King gives you full power to attempt whatever you ſhall judge worth the while. As it is of the laſt importance that <hi>Saverne</hi> be fortify'd ſtrongly, I am perſuaded you will take particular care about it.</p>
               <p>When you were here, I often heard you diſcourſing, of how great Conſequence it wou'd be, if you cou'd get good advanced Quarters this next Winter, inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to the Enemy, and advantageous for your ſelves. It will concern you in point of Prudence, to conſider of this in good time.</p>
               <p>As far as we are able to judge of the Deſigns of <hi>Spain,</hi> particularly by a Diſpatch of a freſh Date, that was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by <hi>Monſieur de Grammont,</hi> their intention is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Galaſſe,</hi> and the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to make an Effort to enter <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Auguſt.</hi> It concerns you and the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> to oppoſe this Attempt, and fruſtrate the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:42519:37"/>
               <p>If you cou'd poſſibly diſengage your ſelf from putting the Caſtle of <hi>Aubar</hi> into the hands of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> it wou'd be much better for us. Beſides, I don't look upon it to be in the leaſt neceſſary to the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> ſince <hi>Saverne</hi> is already comprehended in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> which the King has quitted to him, purſuant to the Articles of the Treaty between them; and that in conſideration of this, his Majeſty will command the Perſon whom you ſhall eſtabliſh in it, to acknowledge him as much as he can deſire. You are Maſter of ſo much Addreſs, that I am confident you can bring over the Duke to any Terms that you judge moſt advantageous for the King's Service, for which reaſon I ſhall ſpeak to you no more upon this Head, aſſuring you that I am, and always will be,</p>

him. However, I perſuade my ſelf that your Goodneſs and Juſtice will induce you to acknowledge, that it never was the intention of that great Prince to diſpleaſe you in whatever has happen'd, but rather to ſerve you, and hinder thoſe who formerly have executed their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt the Holy See from putting themſelves in ſuch a condition, during his Reign, as to give the World any juſt Apprehenſions of their playing the ſame Game over again. Your Holineſs about two Years ago, ſent a Nuncio Extraordinary to <hi>France,</hi> upon an occaſion as contrary to the Intereſts of his Majeſty, as it was favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and recall'd him when that Court gave publick Signs that his Perſon was diſagreeable to them, and apprehended that he dealt for a Peace, againſt their Intention. Now if it ſhould ſo fall out that your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſhou'd perſiſt to oppoſe the Employ of the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal <hi>d'Eſtreés,</hi> in whoſe Perſon are to be found abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Qualities contrary to what the Enemies of this Crown may deſire, there is no Perſon but wou'd believe, altho' erroneouſly, that <hi>Spain,</hi> by her Artifices, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly carry'd your Holineſs to what ſhe moſt of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd. As for my ſelf, this Thought never found any room in my Breaſt, but it concerns your Holineſs in the higheſt degree, to prevent it from taking any footing in the Minds of other People, who perhaps will conclude there is ſomething in it, if you ſhou'd continue to treat the King upon this occaſion, otherwiſe than you do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes that have Ambaſſadors at your Court. I hope your Holineſs will be pleaſed to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe that honour you with a cordial and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Reverence, and thoſe that only give you a few exteriour Marks of it, when their Affairs require ſuch a Conduct. The known Piety of the King naturally leads your Holineſs to this Procedure, his Perſon demands it of you, the preſent Juncture ſeems to oblige your Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to it, ſince nothing can prove ſo directly contrary to a Peace, as to ſhow a diſreſpect to him, who of all other Kings, moſt earneſtly deſires a ſtrict Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with you. As it is an eaſie matter, ſo it will likewiſe be a glorious one to your Holineſs, to preſerve that abſolute Power which you have in the Affection of this great Prince; and I dare engage to you, that the Mareſchal <hi>d'Eſtrées,</hi> for his part, will endeavour no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more zealouſly than to ſerve you, and advance the Intereſts of your whole Family, that by doing ſo,

he may render himſelf ſerviceable to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. If it happens otherwiſe, I freely conſent that your Holineſs ſhou'd lay all the blame upon my ſelf, who ſhou'd take it for a new Obligation, if you wou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to think upon this moſt humble Supplication of mine, and not barely conſider it as ſuch, but as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs with his Majeſty's Prayers, which have no other End but what may be of moſt advantage to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and all your Family.

His Majeſty makes account, ſo ſoon as <hi>Dole</hi> is taken, which News we expect every hour with the greateſt impatience, to order two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince's Army, to march and joyn that of <hi>Picardy,</hi> where there are not above five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; leaving the reſt of the above-mention'd Army, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to tarry ſtill in the <hi>Franche-Comté,</hi> and make Head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Enemy, if they offer to come there, or elſe to march into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> according as he ſhall find it moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for his Affairs. As for what relates to your ſelf, <hi>My Lord,</hi> the King leaves you wholly at your own liberty to act as you ſhall judge moſt advantageous to his Deſigns, and does not preſcribe you any Method to follow, but truſts intirely to your Prudence and your Conduct, to manage your ſelf, as the Motion of the Enemy, and any emergent Occaſions make it proper for you.

               <p>YOU will ſoon imagine that the War goes but ill on our ſide in theſe parts, ſince I have reſolv'd at at laſt to go thither in Perſon, with all the Pains and Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to which you know me ſo ſubject. The Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice of three Raskals, that made no defence for the Garriſons they were intruſted with, has ſo perplex'd our Affairs for the preſent, that I am neceſſitated to make this Journey. You never heard of ſuch perfidious Villains; ſoon after, away they ſled, like Traytors as they were: We have drawn them aſunder between four Horſes, in Effigie, with all the reproachful Marks of Ignominy that con'd poſſibly be thought of, and their Perſons will be treated after the ſame manner, where-ever we happen to find them.</p>
               <p>We ſhall have by the Sixth of the next Month, above ten thouſand Horſe, and twenty five thouſand Foot: With theſe Forces we ſhall march ſtreight towards the Enemy. On one ſide we have <hi>Monſieur</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to ſear, who deſigns to make a Deſcent upon us by the way of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> with his own Troops, and thoſe that were quarter'd in the <hi>Franche-Comté;</hi> and, as I imagine, <hi>Galaſſe,</hi> who might very well have paſs'd the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to re-paſs it at <hi>Briſac,</hi> and ſo marched to joyn him.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:42519:40"/>
               <p>This, <hi>My Lord,</hi> is the Province which we leave to be manag'd by your ſelf, and the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</p>
               <p>We have left a thouſand Horſe, and three thouſand Foot with <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince. Beſides theſe, he may ſtill raiſe three thouſand Men, and five hundred Horſe, with which he will be able to oppoſe the Enemy on one ſide, while you will powerfully make Head againſt him on the other.</p>
               <p>For this effect, it will be wholly neceſſary for you to direct your Courſe towards <hi>Eſpagnol</hi> or <hi>Mircourt,</hi> that you may afterwards take ſuch a way as the marching of the Enemy will oblige you to obſerve. As ſoon as you draw near to the Prince's Army, care ſhall be taken to prevent all manner of Competition, by ſending down an Order to him to go to ſome other place, and to leave his Troops with you. I know very well that 'tis impoſſible to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a more mortifying Condition to you, than to ſend you to the place where the obove-mention'd Perſon has any power: But it cannot be avoided, the neceſſity of our Affairs obliging us to follow this Conduct. You are the only Man, that, together with the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> are able to regulate Matters in thoſe Parts.</p>
               <p>Although our Affairs on this ſide are in a very ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy condition, yet I hope we ſhall be able to retrieve them, ſo ſoon as our Troops are got together. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> quitted all other Deſigns, to make their utmoſt Efforts in <hi>Picardy,</hi> yet if they had not met with ſuch treacherous Villains, I believe they wou'd have had no mighty Matters to boaſt of.</p>
               <p>'Tis my Requeſt to you, to march towards <hi>Burgundy</hi> with all the ſpeed you can, that this Conſternation may produce no ill Effects on that ſide, which will not happen when they ſee you have Forces there able to oppoſe the Deſigns of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Prince has already had the Orders ſent to him, which his Majeſty wou'd have obſerv'd among the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Armies, when they joyn, which is, that every Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſhall command his own Troops. I am apt to think that the ſooner you can advance on this ſide, it will be ſo much the better; for I make no queſtion but <hi>Galaſſe</hi> will endeavour to paſs the River at <hi>Briſac,</hi> to joyn the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> and 'tis of great importance that you ſhou'd ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive there before him.</p>

               <p>The Enemies have poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Village of <hi>Verdun</hi> upon the <hi>Doux,</hi> which is not fortify'd, but 'tis a Paſs of ſome conſequence. Aſſure your ſelf, <hi>My Lord,</hi> that I am, and will be, ſo long as I live, without the leaſt alteration,</p>

               <p>I Want Words to expreſs my Diſſatisfaction at the ill Conduct of the Marquiſs <hi>de Sourdis.</hi> He cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf upon the want of Directions; for he has been written to often enough. If we knew any Man at preſent fit to be put into his place, we ſhou'd take care to have him ſent for home immediately.</p>
               <p>As for the Gentlemen of the Parliament of <hi>Metz,</hi> you will aſſuredly receive all the Satisfaction you can deſire: But I deſire you to have a little patience, till the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Tempeſt be over. After the rate things go now, one wou'd imagine that a Bleſſing attended thoſe that rail'd at the Government. I hope that within two Months it will not be ſo; and then the Parliament of <hi>Metz</hi> ſhall be chang'd, as you deſire it.</p>
               <p>We do all that we can to re-inforce you with ſome Foot. This very Day we order'd the Regiment of <hi>Ronciere</hi> to march, which, in my opinion, will make a very fine one. <hi>Verderonne</hi> is by this time got pretty forward, and ſo is <hi>Decauts.</hi> The Regiment that <hi>Monſieur Vignier</hi> is a raiſing, will be complete in ſeven or eight Days. <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becourt</hi> has ſent us word that he will furniſh us with four thouſand Men; but knowing the Man as you and I do, I ſhou'd be very glad if he brought us but one half of them. Let the worſt come, I take it for granted that he and <hi>Monſieur Vignier</hi> will bring three thouſand effective Men, and <hi>Verderonne, Ronciere,</hi> and <hi>Decauts;</hi> two thouſand
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42519:41"/>
five hundred, beſides the Forces that the Baron <hi>de Chape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,</hi> and one <hi>Anfonville,</hi> intend to raiſe, to put into <hi>Chaumont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Horſe, we expect them from thoſe places where the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> told you.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Sieur Talon,</hi> your Secretary, has receiv'd Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as he will inform you himſelf, as to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fund for Corn. In every thing elſe that lies in my power, you ſhall find the like care taken, to give you all imaginable content.</p>
               <p>The King has given the <hi>Scotch</hi> Regiment to the Baron <hi>Hebron,</hi> which your Letter did not a little promote.</p>
               <p>The Prince has ſent us ſome Letters, which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten very much in your favour. I ſuppoſe that by this time his Troops, and thoſe of <hi>Vaubécourt</hi> have joyn'd you, and that by this means you will be in a condition to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the deſigns of <hi>Galaſſe.</hi> Upon my word, I depend more upon your, and the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi>'s Conduct,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42519:42"/>
although you have but indifferent Forces, than upon all the great Armies which we have on this ſide, which in truth, exceed thirty five thouſand Foot, and twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe in number.</p>
               <p>The Enemy retires too faſt for us. We cou'd wiſh they wou'd be ſo civil as to ſtay till we cou'd come up to them. Their Army does not in reality conſiſt of above eighteen thouſand, as well Foot as Horſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur</hi> has paſſed the River at <hi>Peronne,</hi> with twenty five thouſand Men, and ten thouſand Horſe. The King marches this way towards <hi>Corbie,</hi> with ten thouſand Men, and two thouſand Horſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corbie</hi> at this very Moment is reduc'd to great neceſſity. Thoſe that are in the place are forc'd to eat boil'd Corn, as they did at the Siege of <hi>Paris.</hi> They have Corn in abundance; but their Mills that were lately burnt by the <hi>Sieur de Beau-fort,</hi> failing them, they give ſeven Buſhels of Corn for a Buſhel and a half of Meal. They have in a manner no Wine among them; and to compleat their Miſery, the Plague and Bloody-Flux rage violently in the place.</p>
               <p>I am very glad that you have taken <hi>Chevillon:</hi> You did very well in giving him leave to write. You muſt look after him carefully, and treat him gently, in order to make good uſe of him in time and place, as occaſion ſhall require. There is no good to be hoped from the Maſter of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid <hi>Chevillon,</hi> unleſs meer Neceſſity conſtrains him to it, and it pleaſes God to give us ſome Advantage over our Enemies.</p>
               <p>If the People of the <hi>Franche-Comté</hi> wou'd come again into the Neutrality, the King wou'd do the ſame very willingly. You and the Prince may negotiate this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, according as you find it convenient, if you ſee any tendency towards it.</p>
               <p>We can return no anſwer to <hi>Monſieur de Frangipane,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot liſten to any Treaty of a Peace, but in conjunction with the reſt of our Allies at <hi>Colen,</hi> which is the place appointed for all.</p>
               <p>We have paid two hundred thouſand Crowns to the Duke of <hi>Weymar.</hi> They ſend me word that within three Days there will be nothing due to him.</p>
               <p>You remember what I writ to you concerning the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Sourdis,</hi> and the Affair of the Parliament of <hi>Metz.</hi> Both one and t'other ſhall moſt aſſuredly be done.

His Majeſty has granted him a Penſion of two thouſand Crowns, and given him a Warrant for it, till ſuch time as he has an opportunity to reward his Services ſome other way. For my own particular, I will aſſiſt him as far as lies in my power, as well in conſideration of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as for the recommendation you give me of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I beſeech you to believe that I am, and will be ſo, as long as I live,</p>

               <head>A MEMORIAL. <hi>To the ſame.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the time of <hi>Monſieur de Montmorency, Monſieur le Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier</hi> behav'd himſelf extremely ill, becauſe the other had ſuch an Aſcendant over him, that he made him do what he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>After this, the aforeſaid <hi>Sieur le Premier</hi> manag'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a Conduct not to be miſ-liked, till now of late, being poſſeſſed by ſome obſcure Perſons, that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, he return'd to his former wicked Courſes; which particularly appear'd after the infamous Cowardiſe of his Unkle, who was Governour of <hi>Catelet.</hi> At the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42519:44"/>
of the Siege, he ſaid in publick Company, That he was aſſur'd that his Unkle wou'd not agree to any Capitulation; and if he did, that he wou'd be the firſt to condemn him.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as this Place was baſely and ignominiouſly ſurrender'd, he alter'd his Tone, and had the boldneſs to ſay, That his Unkle had diſcharg'd the part of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man: This anger'd the King. Afterwards his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty having held a Council at <hi>Chaliot,</hi> where it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to apprehend the <hi>Sieur de St. Leger, Monſieur le Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier,</hi> who was then at <hi>Chaliot,</hi> having diſcover'd it, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd a Courrier immediately to his Brother, to inform his Unkle of the Proceedings, and adviſe him to make his Eſcape. Which fell out ſo well for him, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd notice of it two Hours before the Meſſenger that was gone to arreſt him, arriv'd at <hi>Ham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Article being confirm'd by the information of the Poſt-Maſters and Poſtilions, that directed the aforeſaid Courrier of <hi>Monſieur de Saint-Simon,</hi> and of the Innkeepers where he lodg'd, his Majeſty reſolv'd to judge this Matter at the Tryal of the <hi>Sieur de Saint-Leger,</hi> who was condemn'd to be drawn in Pieces by four Horſes; the Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> repreſented to his Majeſty, that it wou'd be much better to let it alone, becauſe it wou'd be too great an Affliction to <hi>Monſieur le Premier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After which, the aforeſaid <hi>Sieur le Premier</hi> teſtifying a great Sorrow and Repentance for this Action, the King, out of his own Goodneſs, advis'd him to go into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. After he had been there fifteen Days, he waited on his Majeſty at <hi>Roye,</hi> and upon ſome Reports running abroad, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſign'd to make a Deſcent upon <hi>Guienne,</hi> begg'd leave of him to go to <hi>Blaye.</hi> When he was gone thither, his Majeſty conſidering his diſaffection to his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, to which he had preferr'd the Intereſt of a Man who had committed an inexcuſable Action, ſent him Word to continue there, and gave his Relations to underſtand, that it was his pleaſure they ſhou'd tarry at their reſpective Houſes, and not come to Court.</p>

               <p>IF the News you ſent me of the Retreat of <hi>Galaſſe,</hi> and the Victory which the King's Arms have obtain'd over him, gave me ſo great a Satisfaction, I am apt to flatter my ſelf that the ſurrendry of <hi>Corbie,</hi> which this Gentleman brings with him, will prove no leſs agreeable to you, ſince I know how overjoy'd you are at every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which God is pleas'd to beſtow upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Affairs. The Enemy is to march out of the Place to Morrow, according to the Capitulation agreed upon; for the performance of which, they have given us by way of Hoſtages, three of the principal Officers of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without demanding any from us. The extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry incommodities they ſuffer'd by the Plague, and other Diſtempers, and by the want of all ſorts of Victuals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Corn, joyn'd to the great Fatigues they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to undergo, to reſiſt four vigorous Attacks, oblig'd them to ſurrender, before they were brought to the laſt Extremities. This happy Action, and the retreat of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe,</hi> will, I ſuppoſe, hinder the Enemies of <hi>France</hi> from boaſting they have done us any great Miſchief, ſince they have ſuffer'd twice as much themſelves, their Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without compariſon more ruin'd than ours, along of the <hi>Germans</hi> who committed all imaginable Cruelties there. I cannot ſufficiently wonder what makes <hi>Monſieur de Longueville</hi> him, behind ſtill, ſeveral Courriers have been diſpatch'd to keep to preſs him to joyn you; nay, I ſent one of my own Gentlemen, to repreſent to him, how neceſſary it was to do it for the wellfare of his Majeſty's Affairs, who is not yet return'd. If <hi>Galaſſe</hi> in his Retreat ſhou'd receive an Overthrow from us, we might ſay truly enough, that his Majeſty's Affairs were never better than they wou'd then be. And I hope it will ſo fall out.</p>
               <p>I cannot expreſs to you how well pleas'd the King is with your Conduct and Services, nor how joyful I am in my own particular, that his Majeſty ſets ſo great an
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42519:45"/>
eſteem upon your Perſon. <hi>Monſieur de Rantzau</hi> cannot be ſufficiently commended: The Action at <hi>Saint-Jean de Laune</hi> was ſo gallant, that he deſerves to have a particular No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of him, to which I ſhall willingly contribute all that lies in my own Power; and pray let me deſire you to ſignifie as much to him. If you are ſo happy as to beat <hi>Galaſſe</hi> back into <hi>Germany,</hi> with ſome remarkable Advantage, beſides what you have already obtain'd over him, it wou'd be highly neceſſary for you, if it is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable, to take your Winter-Quarters in the <hi>Franche-Comté,</hi> and at <hi>Miremont, Eſpinol, Rambervilliers,</hi> and <hi>Mire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.</hi> At leaſt 'tis abſolutely neceſſary to leave them to the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> in caſe you cannot enjoy them both together, for it will be an Advantage to him; and, to ſay the truth, our Frontier wou'd ſoon be ruin'd by the extraordinary Diſorders that Strangers uſe to commit.

               <p>THE reaſon of my writing to you now, is not to tell you how overjoy'd I am at the late Victory which your Army has got over that of <hi>Galaſſe</hi> in the <hi>Franche-Comté;</hi> for you may eaſily imagine how great my Satisfaction is, as well for the Advantage the King's Affairs receive by it, as for the Honour you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd upon this occaſion, the increaſe whereof I no leſs paſſionately deſire, than your ſelf can do, there being no Man living that honours and loves you better than my ſelf. I ſhall content my ſelf with telling you, that this happy Event, joyn'd with the good Succeſs that has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd on this ſide, a full account of which I have ſent you by a Gentleman belonging to the Prince, has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh'd his Majeſty's Affairs in ſo great Reputation,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42519:46"/>
that our very Enemies are forc'd to own, that they were never in a better Condition than they are at preſent.</p>
               <p>By the Diſpatch that the Prince's Gentleman brings you, I have ſent you my Opinion about the Winter-Quarters for the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi>'s Troops, and your own: I long to hear what your Sentiments are upon that Subject.</p>
               <p>I will ſpeak to the King about the two Commiſſions of <hi>Ayde de Camp,</hi> that you writ to me about, as ſoon as I ſee his Majeſty. In the mean time you may look upon it as actually done, for I don't expect to meet the leaſt difficulty in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur de Noyers</hi> is the Man that returns a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Anſwer to all your Diſpatches; which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I forbear to add any thing concerning them here.</p>
               <p>I writ to the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to come to me here, in order to ſend him afterwards to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> to meet his Father; and in truth 'tis abſolutely neceſſary that he ſhou'd undertake this Journey. Pray make no difficulty to let him go.</p>
               <p>I am upon the Road now, going towards his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and have given Orders about every thing that I judg'd uſeful or neceſſary for the ſecurity of <hi>Picardy,</hi> where we have made ſome change in the Governour, which I believe you'll approve of.

               <p>I Am extremely concern'd that you did not find every thing in readineſs, as you might well expect; but 'tis the nature of great Affairs to carry many Difficulties with them; and it often happens that the Sun ſhines brighter after the Storm is over.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe that by this time the Horſes you wanted to draw the Cannon, are arriv'd ſafe, and that <hi>Crié</hi> has given orders for ſubſiſting your four hundred Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that are to carry your Victuals; <hi>Monſieur de Bullion</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made Proviſion for them above ten Days ago.</p>
               <p>As for the other two hundred Horſes, that you want, to make them up in all a hundred and fifty, the <hi>Sieur de Septoutre,</hi> who was employ'd to raiſe them, has given the <hi>Sieur Gargan</hi> a Liſt of the ſeveral places where they are kept; for 'tis ten Days ago ſince he ſignified as much in a Letter to <hi>Monſieur de Noyers,</hi> who has ſent you an account of that whole matter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vercourt</hi> parted from hence on <hi>Saturday,</hi> to wait upon you; but I ſuppoſe he will firſt call upon <hi>Monſieur de Rambure,</hi> at <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur de la Barre</hi> went yeſterday to meet you, and carries with him Money to pay off the Artillery. We are aſſur'd here, that his abſence will do no hurt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Officers that are upon the Spot, have orders to act in his abſence, as far as he himſelf cou'd do, if he was there.</p>
               <p>The Boats went from <hi>Paris</hi> about five Days ago. I am ſorry you had them not all at once, that you might have begun with the better ſhow. But you may want ſeveral things that are abſolutely neceſſary to you, which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my however cannot hinder from coming up to you, your Deſigns not carrying you to leave any place that belongs to them, behind you.</p>
               <p>If your Infantry is not ſo good as you cou'd deſire, we deſign you from this very Moment, two Regiments, of twenty Companies each, to recruit you by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>July,</hi> and two more by the firſt of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To convince you that I will omit nothing that lies within the Sphere of my poor capacity, to ſecond the good Deſigns which you have form'd for his Majeſty's Service, I have ſent you by one of <hi>Monſieur de Noyers</hi>'s Gentlemen, ten thouſand Crowns, that in caſe any thing be wanting to the Horſes that carry your Proviſions, or, in ſhort, any other unforeſeen Accident ſhou'd happen, you may be able to remedy it immediately, and not ſee your Deſigns miſcarry for want of Money.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sieur d' Eſtrade</hi> has communicated to us your two different Projects. Your firſt is, to take <hi>Auchy</hi> in twenty four Hours, which may eaſily be done, and to inveſt <hi>Heſdin</hi> at the ſame time, in order to beſiege it afterwards. The ſecond is, to take <hi>Chaſteau Cambreſis,</hi> which may be done in three or four Days time; and ſo ſoon as you have taken that place, to inveſt <hi>Landrecy,</hi> in order to beſiege it afterwards.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt, you muſt let it alone, becauſe of our Engagement with the Prince of <hi>Orange. Aigueberre</hi> is come back, who went on purpoſe to aſſure him, that we wou'd attack the Enemy on this ſide, without naming the place. So you muſt conſider with all ſpeed, what is to be done with the ſecond Deſign, or any other that you ſhall judge more advantageous. But as for <hi>Heſdin,</hi> you muſt not think of it at preſent, for the Reaſons mention'd above.</p>

               <p>THat which afflicts <hi>Monſieur de Bullion,</hi> rejoyces me; that is to ſay, the Supplies of Money which you demand for the Month's Pay of your Troops. 'Tis true, the Advice I lately receiv'd, that you had not above ten thouſand Men, does ſenſibly grieve me; but ſince the Funds that were erected to diſcharge the aforeſaid Month's Pay, for fifteen thouſand Foot, and ſeven thouſand Horſe, does not ſuffice, we ſhall have more Men by a great deal than we expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur de la Meilleraye</hi> has faithfully promis'd me, that you ſhall want no Military Proviſions, that he ſpoke to you about: I am going this very Moment to give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders concerning them.

               <p>I am ſorry for the diſcovery of the King's Muſqueteer; but in matters of War, a Man had much better depend upon meer Force, than upon Enterprizes, the Succeſs whereof is uncertain. I hope that by carrying on your Affairs with your uſual Vigour, all things will ſucceed

I am no leſs ſatisfy'd to find that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize you are now upon, promiſes ſo fairly; and indeed, 'tis impoſſible to manage any thing with more Prudence and Judgment, than you have ſhown upon that occaſion.</p>
               <p>I don't queſtion but that in a ſhort time you'll be Maſter of <hi>Chaſteau-Cambreſis,</hi> and hope that after that <hi>Landrechy</hi> will make no long oppoſition, tho' the Town is ſtrongly fortify'd, and well provided; ſo great an opinion have I of the good Succeſs of his Majeſty's Arms, and of your Diligence.

               </opener>
               <p>I Have diſpatch'd this Courrier on purpoſe to you, to inform you with all ſpeed, that beſides the Attack which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> makes on the Coaſts of <hi>Bayonne,</hi> he prepares another for <hi>Languedoc,</hi> which he deſigns to make on the Fifteenth of <hi>July.</hi> To facilitate this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, he has ſummoned all the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on all the Coach-Horſes in <hi>Madrid,</hi> to mount the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry. You may eaſily believe that I am well ſatisfied how difficult it is for <hi>Spain</hi> to make two powerful At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks at the ſame time; but however, 'tis very certain that this is their Deſign, and that the Enemy pretend to make a Deſcent upon <hi>Languedoc</hi> both by Sea and by Land. Being no longer employ'd in the Iſlands, their Naval For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may help to execute this Attempt.</p>
               <p>Now to prevent this Storm, I deſire you to advance to <hi>Narbonne</hi> with all Expedition; take the <hi>Sieur d' Argencourt</hi> along with you, to ſee what is neceſſary to be done there, and accordingly put every thing in order without delay. Poſt the Regiment of <hi>Languedoc</hi> in ſome neighbouring place, to help you in caſe of need. Order all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Province to be ready, as likewiſe the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Nobility, and lay up all the Corn you can get in the Country, at <hi>Narbonne.</hi> We have already written to <hi>Monſieur de Vitry,</hi> to ſend you his Regiment; and to the <hi>Meſſieurs d' Harcourt,</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to get the Naval Forces ready to come to your aſſiſtance. I make no doubt, but that by the help of God, and your diligence, the Enemy will be as warmly received in <hi>Languedoc</hi> as they were in the Iſlands.</p>
               <p>I beg of you not to neglect this Advice; and though you ſee but little appearance of their coming to viſit you, yet take it for a certain Truth. I writ to <hi>Monſieur de Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> to acquaint him that this is no Chimerical News; as likewiſe to deſire him to ſecond your good Intentions upon this occaſion. <hi>Monſieur de Barraut</hi> has receiv'd Orders
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42519:53"/>
ſome time ago, to raiſe the Militia, which is now in a State of readineſs to defend the Country of <hi>Foix. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de la Vrillerie</hi> has ſent him word to march with them to your aſſiſtance in caſe of neceſſity, and has ſent you his Majeſty's Diſpatch to that purpoſe; as alſo another to <hi>Monſieur de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ry,</hi> to ſend you his Regiment. You may command both of them to joyn you whenever you judge it expedient. In the mean time, be aſſur'd of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of my Affection, and that I am, and ever will be,</p>

               <p>J Was extremely pleas'd to learn by the <hi>Sieur Arnauld</hi> the good condition of your Army, and the forwardneſs of the Siege you are now engag'd in, where I hope, as heartily as your ſelf can do, that you'll find a ſpeedy and fortunate Succeſs.</p>
               <p>You have been already inform'd, that Orders were ſent to <hi>Monſieur de la Meilleraye</hi> to poſt himſelf near you, and joyn you with his Troops, if you ſhou'd have any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them; having ſent you this advice by the ſame Courrier that brought him the King's Diſpatch upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>The taking of <hi>Garde</hi> by the Count, about which you writ to me, fell out very luckily. As ſoon as ever we knew of it here, a Warrant was immediately diſpatch'd to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Belle-Jambe,</hi> who is at St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> to examine him, and afterwards to do with him as he ſaw convenient. If you have not as yet ſent the above-mention'd <hi>Garde</hi> to St. <hi>Quintin</hi> aforeſaid; pray take care to get him conducted thither in ſafety, it being of great importance to make an Example of him.</p>
               <p>The Advantage which the <hi>Sieur Gaſſion</hi> has obtain'd over the Enemy, has without doubt put them in ſome Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42519:53"/>
I am exceeding glad that he has begun ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and doubt not but he will continue to do the ſame upon all occaſions that ſhall preſent themſelves to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the King's Service, being ſo well acquainted as I am, with his Courage, Fidelity, and Affection.

                  <p>I have hitherto delay'd to diſpatch this Courrier again to you, becauſe we have no News here to ſend you; and I had kept him here ſtill, but that I was afraid you wou'd be in ſome pain about us. <hi>Monſiuer de Noyers</hi> has ſent you an account of all that has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in this part of the World, to which I have nothing to add, but to conjure you, <hi>my Lord,</hi> to take particular care of your Perſon; for I deſire your preſervation as heartily as I do my own.</p>
                  <p>I am overjoy'd to learn by <hi>Monſieur Arnauld,</hi> the ſtate of your Circumvallation. I earneſtly requeſt you to make the Trenches of your Attacks ſo good, that Soldiers and Gentlemen of Quality may be preſerv'd ſafe in them; becauſe your Military Men are ſuch Enemies to all Sieges, that if they ſee they cannot be tolerably ſecur'd, they grow ſick of them immediately: But when they once ſee that due care is taken of them, I hope they'll reliſh the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo well, that after <hi>Landrechy</hi> is reduc'd, we may pretend to go upon ſome greater Exploit. In God's Name, have a care of your Perſon, and do not expoſe your ſelf to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that come from your Army, give me ſuch good aſſurances of the great Care, and Diligence, and Affection, which the <hi>Sieur N.</hi> has expreſs'd for his Majeſty's Service there, that I find my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to tell you, that if 'tis really ſo, and you have not any reaſon to queſtion his Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I am of opinion that he ought not to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till ſuch time as we have farther Light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter, notwithſtanding what I writ to you in my former Letter.

               <p>Every one here knows well enough what a Train of Difficulties attend a Siege, and therefore don't deſire that you ſhould haſten your Attacks more than you can do it in Prudence. I can aſſure you that this is not only his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Opinion, but likewiſe of all thoſe that have the honour to be near his Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur de la Meilleraye</hi> is marched to joyn you, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Orders he has receiv'd from hence, occaſion'd by what you writ to us ſome time ago, <hi>viz.</hi> that you wanted to be re-inforced with ſome Troops. He is ready to act as you ſhall order him; the only reaſon why we ſent him, being to execute your commands, either on the Siege, or any where elſe, where you think fit to employ him.</p>
               <p>Since you are of opinion, that you ſtill want Horſes to fetch in your Proviſions, we are going to raiſe two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more, in order to relieve yours when they begin to be harraſſed.

                  <hi>Bergerac</hi> told me as from you, that you have receiv'd advice, that the Enemy are taking abundance of Cannon out of <hi>Sedan,</hi> to be employ'd againſt us.

               <p>I have ſpoken to the King about what you were pleaſed to write to me, that it was high time to find out a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour for the Town. His Majeſty was of opinion, that the two fitteſt Men in your Army, were <hi>Nettancourt,</hi> and <hi>Vaubecourt;</hi> but the latter he thinks the properer of the two, in regard of <hi>Nettancourt</hi>'s Religion, which wou'd extremely prejudice the reputation of his Majeſty, and check the progreſs we may expect to make in <hi>Flanders.</hi> So you muſt put the aforeſaid <hi>Sieur de Vaubecourt</hi> with his Regiment, and ſuch other Troops as you ſhall judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, into the place, as well to guard as to fortifie it.</p>
               <p>We continue to make a conſiderable Progreſs in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> as well on the part of <hi>Monſieur de Longueville,</hi> as of the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Granſay.</hi>

               <p>YOU will receive two of my Letters in one Day. The latter comes to inform you that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> having been in great Pain at ſome Reports that have been ſcatter'd abroad, that your Army conſiſts of no more than eight or nine thouſand Men; I beſeech you, that for the future you will not ſuffer the Commiſſaries that make the Reviews, to order their Accounts, ſo as has been practiſed of late. They cannot be too exact to ſet down no more Men than they find in the Army; but then 'tis reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould put thoſe in the Number, that are reckon'd in Pay. Now in their preſent Supputations, they never rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon the Captain, the Lieutenant, the Enſign, the two Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, the Drummer, the Haut-boy, and the Quartermaſter; nor what is more, the three Men that are allowed to the three great Officers, for want of which they are forced to take other Soldiers, when their Baggage marches. Thus not reckoning in every Company the eleven Men that are effectually there, it comes to paſs, that in a Regiment conſiſting of twenty Companies, we loſe two hundred and twenty Men. By this means the Enemy having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Spies in our Army, and knowing that People are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom guilty of making their numbers leſs than they are, imagine that we are fewer than in reality we are; which may occaſion a world of inconveniences.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sieur Uſquerque,</hi> who is Secretary to the States, has been again with us, to be informed of the Truth of your Army, which is repreſented ſo ſmall on this ſide, that it looks as if theſe Gentlemen wou'd uſe this as an Excuſe for not doing the great Service we expected from them. 'Tis to little purpoſe for us to tell them how things
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42519:57"/>
really are; for People are apter to believe the flying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of an Army than our Aſſurances; which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable damage to us.</p>
               <p>We have diſpatched two Courriers to the States, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them that his Majeſty's Forces at <hi>Landrechy,</hi> make up in all eighteen thouſand Foot, and eight thouſand Horſe. And I believe we don't over-reckon our ſelves, ſince we paid for almoſt thirteen thouſand Foot, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand Horſe, when you had no more than the Forces that you carried with you at firſt; and <hi>Monſieur de la Meilleraye</hi> afterwards joyned you, as I compute, with five thouſand Men, and fifteen hundred Horſe.</p>
               <p>We have ſent to <hi>Monſieur de Chaſtillon</hi> to remedy the ſame ill way of reckoning, which might happen in his Army, if we did not take care to prevent it, that by this means we may hinder all manner of Spies from repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to be weaker than we are; which is one of thoſe things that did us the moſt miſchief laſt Year, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make our Enemies paſs for much ſtronger than they really were, to their great advantage.</p>
               <p>At laſt the Count has made his Peace with the King; but he is to reſide at <hi>Sedan</hi> for ſome Years. He ſigned the Oath of Fidelity at the ſame time that <hi>Pico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomini</hi> had ſent Orders to him, and after the Queen-Mother had ſigned a Treaty at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> with the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Infant,</hi> to engage him beforehand. <hi>Bautru</hi> parts to morrow, with the King's Almoner, to receive his Oath upon the <hi>Holy Evangeliſts.</hi> This is all I can tell you about this Affair, which I hope will have a happy Concluſion. In the mean time, I conjure you to believe that I am,</p>

               <p>'TIS impoſſible for me to repreſent to you his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Joy for the taking of <hi>Landrechy,</hi> which is ſo great, that it can receive no addition. As for my ſelf, beſides the Joy I receive for the proſperity of <hi>France,</hi> I have a particular one for the Glory you have acquir'd by this great Action. No Man could have carried on the Siege of that place with more Prudence than you have done. I am raviſh'd that you have eſcaped wounding all this while, fince I am inform'd by all thoſe Gentlemen that are come from thence, that as you very worthily diſcharg'd your Employment, ſo you did amiſs in one point, which obliges you to take as great care of your Perſon, as I find you neglected it. I conjure you to change this way of procedure for the future; as alſo to remember, that if the King ſhould loſe a Perſon of your conſequence, all the Advantages we might otherwiſe obtain over the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, would be inconſiderable, and your Friends incapable of receiving Conſolation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur Arnauld</hi> has acquainted us with what you think your ſelf able to do at preſent, which really, in my opinion, is the beſt Deſign that can be taken in hand. By this means you will not ruine your Army, you will ſecure your Winter-Quarters; and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who continually ask us to enter into the Heart of the Country, will be ſatisfy'd, if you can but be able to fortifie the Poſt there, which is propoſed to you. His Majeſty gives you full power to act as you ſhall ſee convenient; and thinks fit, as you will find by the Diſpatch of <hi>Monſieur de Noyers,</hi> that you purſue thoſe Deſigns which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us by the above-mention'd <hi>Sieur Arnauld.</hi> I hope you will prove as ſucceſsful in them, as you were in the beginning of this Campagne. The Troops of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colomini</hi> are not as yet come up; and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who has waited twenty days at <hi>Ramekins</hi> for fair Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, has been conſtrain'd by the badneſs of the Seaſon,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42519:58"/>
to diſembark his Army, and go upon another Deſign: He reſolved laſt <hi>Thurſday,</hi> as <hi>Saladin,</hi> whom I ſent away to <hi>Monſieur de Charnacé,</hi> brings me word, upon the Siege of <hi>Breda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have ſent <hi>Vercourt</hi> back again to you, who talks nothing but Miracles of his Deſign. If the place is ſuch as he repreſents it, capable of being fortified, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by other Poſts which you may take upon the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi> it will be very advantageous for us, and ſerve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode the Enemy. I return you no Anſwer to the Compliments you were pleaſed to ſend me about <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de la Meilleraye,</hi> whom I eſteem ſufficiently happy, if he has been able to pleaſe you. The firſt Deſign of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> wou'd have obliged us to put our ſelves in a readineſs to march another way, according as he ſhould have had occaſion for us. But now ſince we are more at liberty, you may act as you pleaſe. He is exceedingly well pleaſed with your Civilities; and I am aſſur'd that he will always render to you that which is your due.</p>
               <p>I hope that before <hi>Breda</hi> is taken, we ſhall do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth the while; and perhaps ſome Opportunity may preſent it ſelf to you, which neither you nor I think of at preſent. I heartily wiſh for one that may put it into my power, to convince you by my Actions, how affectionately I am, and ever ſhall be,</p>

               <p>THE King advancing now towards <hi>Soiſſons</hi> and <hi>Laon,</hi> as I have already ſent you word, I take Pen in hand to acquaint you, that his Majeſty wou'd be very glad to take ſuch meaſures, that if it were poſſible, his Journey might not be wholly fruitleſs: For this reaſon he has had ſome Thoughts, that while you advance into the Enemy's Country, purſuant to your Deſigns, he might, under the covert of your Army, make a ſort of a Blockade about <hi>Capelle,</hi> by which means that place, in all probability, wou'd in a ſhort time fall into his Hands.</p>
               <p>Before he embarks in this Deſign, his Majeſty deſires that you wou'd ſend a Party of Horſe to view the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try round about the place, commanded by ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Perſon, who might obſerve what may be done to incommode it. <hi>Bezancon,</hi> who has been there, tells us, that to hinder any Proviſions from coming into the Town, there needs no more but to place a good Garriſon at a Village which lies between <hi>Avenes</hi> and <hi>Capelle,</hi> call'd <hi>Eſtren,</hi> where ſome Forces might conveniently intrench them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I am apt to believe that this alone will not be ſufficient: Now if it were poſſible without taking off any of your Troops from what you have deſign'd, to get three thouſand Foot, and a thouſand Horſe, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the reducing of the above-mention'd place, this ſmall Progreſs, joyn'd to thoſe you will make, would put a happy End enough to this Campagne. I conclude this Letter with aſſuring you that I am, and ever will be,</p>

               <p>I Send you this Letter to acquaint you, that we have ſent you fifty thouſand <hi>Franks</hi> to pay for the Fortifications of <hi>Landrechy,</hi> and thoſe new Works you intend to make; and twenty eight thouſand <hi>Franks</hi> for two Months Pay due to the Garriſons of <hi>Landrechy</hi> and <hi>Chaſteau en Cambreſis.</hi> In a word, you ſhall never want Money for the future to carry on any of your Deſigns, however you may have been diſappointed hitherto. The main point of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is, to loſe no time; for we are aſſur'd on all hands, that the Conſternation in <hi>Flanders</hi> is ſo great, that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a fairer opportunity to undertake ſome noble En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize than now. All our Advices bring us word, that <hi>Picolomini</hi> has in effect but fifteen hundred Horſe, fit for Battel; and from five to ſix thouſand Foot; with five or ſix thouſand Women.</p>
               <p>If you have found out any convenient Poſt, that you know is proper to be fortify'd, I am confident you will loſe no time till you have made your ſelf Maſter of it, this being a Matter of great importance.</p>
               <p>We have ſent <hi>Vercourt</hi> forward on his Journey, who made the Propoſal you know of, and muſt by this time be within a few Miles of you. He has all along propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſurprize the place he nam'd to you, which, cou'd it be effected, it wou'd, in my opinion, be of mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to us, becauſe we have reaſon to fear, that if we lay Siege to <hi>Maubeuge</hi> before we have poſſeſſed our ſelves of this place, the Enemy will pour ſome of their Troops into it, which will render the Affair more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult afterwards. But, <hi>my Lord,</hi> you muſt take every thing I make bold to propoſe to you, whether in this, or any other matter, as my bare Thoughts, of which you are to take no notice, any farther than you find them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; it being impoſſible to give good Advice at ſo great a diſtance.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:42519:59"/>
               <p>What I deſire moſt paſſionately of all is, that we may employ the remainder of the Campagne to good purpoſe, as well on our ſide, as all the reſt, where we have begun it ſo happily.</p>
               <p>You muſt remember to keep your Soldiers in that ſtrict Diſcipline, that the People of <hi>Landrechy</hi> may find no ill treatment at their Hands, endeavouring to avoid all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, as much as poſſible, in that place, and every where elſe.

               <p>AFter the King had heard the Relation of the <hi>Sieur du Pleſſis Bezancon,</hi> his Majeſty came to be of the ſame Opinion with your ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> that it wou'd be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make Head againſt the Enemy upon the <hi>Sambre,</hi> with a powerful Body, and to attack <hi>Avenes</hi> forcibly with another, than to block up <hi>Capelle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have again diſpatch'd the aforeſaid <hi>Sieur du Pleſſis</hi> to you, to let you know what Troops we can ſpare to joyn yours, that ſo you may conſider how you wou'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute them, to put theſe two Deſigns in execution, in caſe you judge it worth the while, and that an occaſion does not preſent it ſelf to you, to undertake ſome great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Exploit, which oftentimes happens when a Man thinks the leaſt of it.</p>
               <p>We take it for granted, that the firſt thing we ought to go upon, and which you have already taken care for, is to ſee whether the Deſign of <hi>N,</hi> propoſed by ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42519:60"/>
be really advantageous, and probable to ſucceed. If the ſucceſs of it is feaſible, as <hi>Vercourt</hi> propoſes it, 'tis highly probable, that being in the heart of the Enemy's Country, we ſhall moſt effectually incommode him.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> has ſent to inform us what a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs the Siege of <hi>Breda</hi> was in on the 28th. of <hi>July.</hi> His Lines of Circumvallation were finiſh'd, ſo that he lay under no apprehenſions of being diſlodg'd. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes himſelf to be Maſter of the place by the 20th. of <hi>September,</hi> and makes no great account of the Garriſon, as knowing it conſiſts of no more than two thouſand five hundred Men. He informs us, that the greateſt part of the Towns in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Breda</hi> among the reſt, are but ſlenderly provided with Ammunition, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges us to undertake ſome Siege in the heart of the Country, meaning <hi>Mons</hi> or <hi>Valenciennes.</hi> I don't ſend you this account, as you perhaps may imagine, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether theſe things are practicable, but only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with what has been communicated to us.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, we have ſurprized a Letter at Sea, written by the <hi>Cardinal Infant</hi> to the Emperour, after the taking of <hi>Landrechy,</hi> wherein he complains of <hi>Picolomini</hi> and tells him, their Affairs are in a deplorable condition, if the <hi>French,</hi> making a right uſe of their Victory, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance into the heart of the Country. He poſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures him, that he cannot take the Field againſt the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> with leſs than thirteen thouſand Foot, and five thouſand Horſe; and that he has none but <hi>Balancon</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the <hi>French,</hi> who has no more than five thouſand Foot, and thirty Troops of Horſe, reckoning <hi>Picolomini</hi>'s Forces, which he ſays don't amount to eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, and five thouſand Foot, altho' the other wou'd have them paſs for more. He concludes that none but God can remedy their Affairs.</p>
               <p>Now conſidering all this, which is moſt certainly true, I leave it to your Prudence to ſee what may be done with the Re-inforcement that is marching up to you.</p>
               <p>We can ſtrengthen you with fifteen hundred Horſe, compoſed of a thouſand commanded by the <hi>Sieur de Buſſy,</hi> and five hundred more that are at <hi>Doulans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We can likewiſe give you the Regiments of <hi>Picardy, Navarre,</hi> and the two <hi>Brezez,</hi> that are quartered near <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans;</hi> which, reckoning the Officers, make up four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand effective Men in all.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:42519:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>More than this, we can give you the Regiments of <hi>Belnave, Xaintonge, Bachevilliers, Caſtlenau,</hi> and <hi>Montmeze,</hi> that will make up four thouſand Men more.</p>
               <p>Now I leave it to your conſideration, whether when you have receiv'd this Re-inforcement, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Beſides the above-mention'd Forces, I am of opinion we ſhall be able next <hi>September,</hi> to give you ſix Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more, <hi>viz. Sauvebeuf, Rochegiffard, Niſſay, Saint-Aubin, Aubeterre, Langeron;</hi> which within theſe two Months have been ſet on foot anew, with their old Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. You ſhall aſſuredly receive a Month's Pay before the Month is out.</p>
               <p>As for Money, which will be neceſſary for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of your Troops, I promiſe it ſhall never be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. At this very Moment, beſides the fifty thouſand Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres that were remitted to you a few Days ago for this purpoſe, I have ſent you thirty thouſand Livres more, that if you make an Attempt upon <hi>N,</hi> you may want nothing.</p>
               <p>All that I have written to you above being preſuppos'd, although the King gives you full liberty to act as you ſhall ſee moſt convenient for his Service; and 'tis a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter for a Man to give his Advice at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet for all that, I am of opinion, that if you cou'd ſucceed at <hi>N,</hi> and the place is really as advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as it is repreſented to be, it wou'd be no very hard matter, by keeping a conſiderable Body in all the good Country that lies between this Poſt and <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> to take <hi>Avenes,</hi> with a few Horſe, and no great number of Foot.</p>
               <p>In a word, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I leave all to your Prudence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching you to believe, that as I by no means deſire you to attempt any thing above your power, ſo we at leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that you ſhould perform all you are capable of doing.</p>
               <p>Heaven be praiſed, every thing goes well on all ſides. We do better and better every Day in the <hi>Franche-Comté.

Since which advice, the aforeſaid <hi>Sieur de Roquepine</hi> aſſures us, that they loſe ſo many Men, as well by want of Proviſions, as by ſickneſs, that he believes they cannot be above five thouſand five hundred at moſt. By this we may conclude that it will be impoſſible for him to march into <hi>Flanders</hi> at the head of 13 or 1400 Horſe, and 4000 Foot; ſo that by God's help he will not be in a capacity to do us a Miſchief.</p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:42519:61"/>
                  <p>I conclude from this Account, and the Siege of <hi>Breda,</hi> that till the 20th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or thereabout, you will have no great Buſineſs upon your hands; becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will endeavour all they can, to hinder the Lines of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvallation from being finiſh'd at <hi>Breda;</hi> and when they find there is no poſſibility of ſaving that Town, 'tis probable they will come to attack us in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that we may be ſo happy as to conclude this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne with a ſucceſsful Battle.</p>

                  <salute>My Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Was extremely glad to be inform'd by yours of the 9th. of this Month, after what manner Affairs went on your ſide. You found by my former Letter, which I gave <hi>Monſieur de Combour</hi> to deliver to you, that the King gives you full liberty to act at your Diſcretion, and that your Advices and ours did not differ.</p>
               <p>I never knew particularly what ſort of a place St. <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> was, for which reaſon I writ to you concerning it, as a thing fit to be undertaken, if you judged it worth the while. The Difficulties we muſt expect to find there now, upon account of the two Men that were hanged, have wholly alter'd the Face of this Affair; ſo that we muſt comfort our ſelves, if <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> as you repreſent it, can do us the ſame kindneſs. In ſuch a caſe it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for you to fortifie your ſelf there as well as you can. I did not ſo much apprehend the difficulty of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king St. <hi>Guillain,</hi> as that of keeping it, which cou'd not be done without great Convoys, that require abundance of Troops, and in the Winter are almoſt impoſſible. If we cou'd take <hi>Avenes,</hi> as I moſt aſſuredly believe we may, we ſhou'd have reaſon to ſay that this Campagne was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd happily enough. This is therefore the Point to which we muſt ſtick; and by keeping the <hi>Sambre,</hi> whereof
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42519:62"/>
now you are Maſter, ſtill in your power, you may hinder the Enemy from coming to the relief of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bezancon,</hi> when he was here, promiſed to do Wonders in the good ordering of the Army; for which reaſon we have ſent him word to go to wait upon you, that by your Orders he might as far as is poſſible, hinder the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from making havock of the Corn; for I well fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that it will be an impoſſible Matter to furniſh ſo great a Body with Corn enough, if you don't make them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt upon what you find in the Country; where, as I am informed, 'tis exceedingly plentiful. In the mean time, one <hi>Touches,</hi> of <hi>Metz,</hi> is gone to convoy four or five hundred Muids of Corn that are now at <hi>Guiſe,</hi> to <hi>Landrechy,</hi> in which he will be forced to employ more than two hundred Horſes which you demanded; and which have been employ'd in carrying one thing or another ever ſince you have taken the Field.</p>
               <p>A Meſſage has been ſent to <hi>Monſieur Lambert</hi> to joyn <hi>de Buſſy</hi>'s Army at <hi>Eſtren,</hi> between <hi>Capelle</hi> and <hi>Avenes,</hi> and to ſtay there till you ſend him farther Orders.</p>
               <p>As for the Owners of the Horſes that bring Proviſions to your Army, they ſhall have all due encouragement to make them continue in the Service. In the mean time you muſt take care to prevent them from leaving you.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen a Letter of the <hi>Sieur Arnauld,</hi> dated the 10th. of this Month, and written to the Reverend <hi>F. Joſeph,</hi> wherein he wonders that the Month's Pay, which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his account, ought to have arrived at the Army on the 15th. was not yet come. The aforeſaid <hi>Sieur</hi> indeed, when he was here, ſollicited for a Month's Pay for the 15th. upon which I was reſolv'd to uſe all my Intereſt with <hi>Monſieur de Bullion,</hi> to have it got ready, and do the ſame every Day, and yet I cannot bring him to name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preciſe time. All that I can aſſure you of at preſent, is that it ſhall be ready without fail ſome time this Month.</p>
               <p>As for Money to carry on the Works, you have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy receiv'd the fifty thouſand Livres ſent for <hi>Landrechy,</hi> and thirty thouſand more, which <hi>l' Eſpine</hi> brought you for St. <hi>Guillain</hi> or <hi>Maubeuge.</hi> I ſent you word that you ſhou'd want nothing; and here I repeat the ſame Promiſe to you. I cou'd wiſh with all my Heart that you had ſuch a brave. Fellow with you as <hi>Terrail</hi> was, who petarded ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Towns belonging to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> for the Arch-Duke, for that perhaps is one of the things that we want to try, ſince the greateſt part of the Enemy's Towns lie naked and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42519:62"/>
unprovided, I am perſuaded you will loſe no opportunity to undertake any thing that you judge proper to be done for the King's Service: For which reaſon I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſay any more to you; only give me leave to aſſure you that I am, and always will be,</p>

               <p>AFter I had heard <hi>Monſieur de la Meilleraye</hi> upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Journey, I am of Opinion, that of all the Deſigns which he propoſes on your part, there are only two that can be reaſonably undertaken; that is to ſay, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Siege of <hi>Cambray,</hi> or that of <hi>Avenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That of <hi>Cambray</hi> indeed is of much greater importance, but it is to be feared that the Seaſon is already too far advanced, and that we have not all the Preparatives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for ſuch a Deſign, eſpecially People to ſupply the Army, ſo as ſeveral Accidents, which often happen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly, may require.</p>
               <p>As for that of <hi>Avenes,</hi> beſides that it is more feaſible, it ſeems to be more agreeable to the preſent ſtate of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. It will ſtand us in mighty ſtead to preſerve all the Poſts we have taken upon the <hi>Sambre,</hi> the keeping of which is a ſort of Circumvallation for the aforeſaid Siege. So that by making our ſelves Maſters of <hi>Beaumont, Solre,</hi> and <hi>Chimay,</hi> if we pleaſe, the place will be ſurrounded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42519:63"/>
being formally ſo. During this Siege, the greateſt part of his Majeſty's Horſe being intrench'd at <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> with four thouſand Men, will make Head againſt the Enemy, who will not dare to oppoſe or give them Battel; and we may make ſeveral Attempts upon them in Parties.</p>
               <p>What will chiefly contribute to the execution of this Deſign, will be to loſe no time to detach the Troops that are to march thither, out of your Army, and to give them neceſſary Orders to joyn on ſome prefix'd Day at the above-mention'd place.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>my Lord,</hi> if you'll give me leave to tell you my Opinion: You have three things to do; in the firſt place, you muſt ſecure <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> whether by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the whole Town, or by making a good Redoubt, capable of maintaining the Lodgment of the Horſe that will be in the place. You muſt make as great a Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine of Corn and Forrage at <hi>Maubeuge</hi> as is poſſible, and preſerve the Country behind the <hi>Sambre,</hi> as far as the <hi>Oyſe</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> that you may take up Winter-Quarters there for the greateſt part of our People.</p>
               <p>After all I have ſaid to you, the King entirely leaves it to your own choice, to undertake which of theſe two Deſigns you judge moſt proper. However, if you ſhou'd have a fair opportunity in the mean time to petard any place, you wou'd do well to make the Experiment. <hi>Monſieur de la Meilleraye</hi> tarries here two Days, and then he will moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly return to you: But we thought it convenient to diſpatch this Courrier to you beforehand, that neither <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de la Meilleraye</hi>'s tarrying here two Days longer, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other conſideration, ſhou'd make you loſe one ſingle Moment, to diſpoſe every thing for the execution of what you ſhall pitch upon, now you have ſeen the King's Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the matter.

               <p>I Have received your Letter, dated the 23d. of this Month. In anſwer to which, I muſt take the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to tell you, that if you imagine the King is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with your Services, you wrong him; and if in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that, you think ſome ill Offices have been done you here, you are much miſtaken. This I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that no one has mention'd your Name without doing you that Juſtice which you deſerve; but indeed if to extol a Man's Merits as high as 'tis poſſible, be a Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, a world of People here have treſpaſſed againſt you, who I am afraid will never repent, or beg your pardon for doing it.

Such Deſires are always reaſonable, when they don't exceed the Bounds of poſſibility; and to ſay
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42519:65"/>
the truth, I don't believe there is any place in the World where this <hi>Decorum</hi> is better obſerv'd than here, where you muſt know you have ſuch extraordinary Friends, that tho' they ſhou'd ſometimes diſpenſe with this Rule, yet they wou'd never do it where you are concerned. I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beg of you to quit theſe unjuſt Opinions, proteſting to you by that Sincerity of which I always made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that what I have told you is true. And ſince Diligence is one of the moſt requiſite Qualifications in a Perſon that poſſeſſeth your Poſt, continue, I beſeech you, to employ the remainder of the Campagne to as much advantage as you hitherto have done ſince the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. The Siege of <hi>Breda</hi> goes on very well. The Advices you receiv'd that the Enemy had taken <hi>Nimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> are falſe. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> don't ſeem to apprehend the leaſt danger from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

He is now employ'd in the Siege of <hi>Damvilliers,</hi> where there are ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Soldiers in Garriſon, and about the ſame number of the Country Militia. He expects to reduce it by the 8th. of <hi>October</hi> at the fartheſt, by which time I don't queſtion but that you'll have try'd every thing that carries any Face of Succeſs: To which I ſhall contribute on my part all that lies in my power, ſince no Man honours you more, or is with greater ſincerity than my ſelf,</p>

               <p>SInce ſome unexpected Difficulties, that cou'd not be foreſeen, have knocked your deſign upon <hi>Avenes</hi> in the Head, I can ſay nothing to it. We can only make our ſelves ſome amends by taking <hi>Capelle.</hi> I cou'd wiſh that we had known this Reſolution four Days ago, having ſent an Expreſs to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> that you had laid Siege to <hi>Avenes,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur de Chaſtillon</hi> to <hi>Damvilliers.</hi> We muſt diſpatch another Meſſenger to him, to acquaint him with the reaſon of this Alteration; however I am afraid that this will make him judge ill of our intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, although you know well enough there is no reaſon for it. Since the Situation of <hi>Avenes</hi> is ſuch, that it cannot well be attack'd at this Seaſon of the Year, we muſt ſo contrive matters as to make it fall into our Hands this Winter, by the Difficulties they'll find to ſubſiſt a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Garriſon wholly by Convoys, which we may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a manner impracticable to them, ſince we have <hi>Royaumont</hi> and <hi>Solre</hi> already in our Hands, and you deſign
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42519:66"/>
to make your ſelf Maſter of <hi>Chimay:</hi> All which Garriſons, if they do but watch their opportunities, will ſoon ruine the Trade of the aforeſaid Convoys.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt important things is to fortifie <hi>Maubeuge</hi> ſtrongly, and that with ſpeed. Finding by the Letter you ſent to me by the <hi>Sieur Arnaud d' Andilly,</hi> that you reckon the fortifying of it will coſt fourſcore thouſand <hi>Franks,</hi> I have now ſent you fifty thouſand, which, with the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you have already receiv'd, will make up the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Summ. I beg of you to carry on the Works with all diligence, and manage them ſo, that ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be employ'd upon ſeveral Works, in order to make the greater haſte. I can aſſure you, that although I have other Affairs of no leſs conſequence upon my hands, which make me never paſs a Night without thinking on them, and putting my Invention upon the rack to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance them, yet I am ſure I take as much care of your Buſineſs as I do of any thing elſe. There is a neceſſity not only to work hard upon the Fortifications of <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> but likewiſe upon thoſe of <hi>Landrechy,</hi> of <hi>Chaſteau-Cambreſis,</hi> and thoſe places you deſign to keep for your Winter-Quarters.</p>
               <p>'Tis alſo neceſſary to lay up a ſufficient Magazine of Corn at <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> that may laſt till Harveſt-time, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe 'tis of no purpoſe to beſtow Money upon fortifying it. For this effect, we have given twenty thouſand Crowns to <hi>Gargan,</hi> to buy up all the Corn he can find in the Neighbourhood: If he ſhou'd not lay them out as we directed him, he wou'd do us a great Injury. Pray ſend me word whether he deals faithfully with us, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to it by the Authority you have over him. Thus I hope we ſhall be the ſooner able to fill this Magazine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Money ſhall be wanting for that purpoſe. Reſt aſſur'd that I am, and ever will be,</p>

I ſent this Courrier to you, in the firſt place to beg one Favour of you, tho' I know you need no ſollicitation in it, which is to haſten your Siege as much as you can: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to tell you that <hi>Monſieur de Chavigny</hi> ſets out to morrow, to meet you, and will be next <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning at <hi>Gapelle,</hi> where I pray don't let him go to the Trenches, a Man of his Profeſſion having nothing to do there. He will communicate all our Thoughts to you. In the mean time, ſending a Diſpatch to <hi>Monſieur de Châtillon,</hi> to give him orders to lay up Proviſions at <hi>Rocroy,</hi> and the Towns upon the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> I will tell you beforehand, that if the <hi>Cardinal Infant</hi> takes the way of <hi>Cambray,</hi> you muſt with all expedition ſend twelve hundred Men at leaſt, one half to St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> and the other half to <hi>Peron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> and three hundred Horſe to each of theſe two places; by which means the Enemy will be able to do nothing on that ſide. I am of opinion likewiſe, that it will be neceſſary to ſend back the Cavalry of poor <hi>Rambure</hi> to <hi>Dourlans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can aſſure you, and <hi>Monſieur de Chavigny</hi> will do the ſame, that the <hi>Cardinal Infant</hi> cannot bring above four thouſand Foot and two thouſand Horſe into the Field, being conſtrain'd to leave the remainder of his Troops, to prevent the Incurſions which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> may make into the Country, after <hi>Breda</hi> is taken.</p>
               <p>This is the true State of the Enemy on that ſide. And then <hi>Picolomini</hi> and <hi>Balancon,</hi> having both in Horſe and Foot not above nine or ten thouſand Men at moſt, the greateſt part of which are unarm'd, 'tis impoſſible for them to make a Body of above fifteen or ſixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men in all.</p>
               <p>In all probability they will not abandon their Poſt at <hi>Mons,</hi> becauſe then they will have the Heart of the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42519:69"/>
Country open, and give an opportunity to <hi>Monſieur de Candalle</hi> to cut off their Rear.</p>
               <p>Now if they leave any Forces at <hi>Mons,</hi> they cannot leave leſs than four or five thouſand Men, by which means they will not be able to bring above ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men into the Field; in which caſe it will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to have a thouſand Horſe in <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> and four thouſand Foot with <hi>Monſieur de Tureune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may likewiſe ſpare from your Siege, ſince the Lines of Circumvallation are now finiſh'd, a thouſand Horſe, and ſeven thouſand Foot, and ſo have always more than ſix thouſand Horſe, and from nine to ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, to bring into the Field, which <hi>Monſieur de Candalle</hi> may command, till the Siege you are now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in, gives you leave to be there in Perſon. And when once the aforeſaid Siege is over, I hope I ſhall ſoon be ſo happy as to aſſiſt at a <hi>Te Deum</hi> for a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you have obtain'd. I deſire it, <hi>my Lord,</hi> no leſs for your Reputation, than for the Welfare of his Majeſty's Affairs, as being with the utmoſt ſincerity,</p>

               <p>I Have diſpatch'd the Bearer hereof, whoſe Name is <hi>Garde,</hi> on purpoſe to tell you, that the King has ſent with all expedition for twelve hundred Horſe out of <hi>Monſieur de Chaſtillon</hi>'s Army, and that he ſends four Companies of his Guards, and the Regiment of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giffard,</hi> which conſiſts of twelve hundred Men, and was quarter'd about <hi>Senlis,</hi> to St. <hi>Quintin</hi> and <hi>Peronne,</hi> that by this means you might be able to keep all your Troops together, without ſending them to thoſe two places, as I deſir'd you to do yeſterday. I here once more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that the <hi>Cardinal Infant</hi> has brought but two thouſand Horſe, and four thouſand Men with him, and you may take my word for it, 'tis as true as Goſpel. Provided that one cou'd avoid a diſadvantageous Battel, between this and ſix Days hence, if <hi>Capelle</hi> were once taken, we ought to contrive ſome way or other to fight the Enemy, and I hope we ſhou'd come off with no leſs Succeſs than we have uſed to do of late.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> has juſt now gain'd a Battel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he has totally defeated, ſeven thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe, tho' he had not above five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe. In this Action the Enemy loſt all their Cannon and Equipage. I have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong opinion, that we ſhall have ſome good Succeſs; but however we muſt take <hi>Capelle</hi> with all ſpeed; and in the mean time be careful to avoid any ill-favour'd Shock, which in my poor Judgment is eaſily done, ſince this is the third time that I have ſent you a true account of the Enemy's Force.

               <head>A MEMORIAL. <hi>To the ſame.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IF the advice we juſt now receiv'd is true, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Cardinal Infant</hi> is march'd with the Troops of his own Army, and thoſe of <hi>Picolomini,</hi> to <hi>Nivelles,</hi> and has taken the way of <hi>Pont-du-Loup</hi> upon the <hi>Sambre,</hi> we are of opinion here, that they have only one of theſe two things left to do; either to poſſeſs themſelves of <hi>Beaumont,</hi> as <hi>Monſieur de Candalle</hi> imagines, in which caſe 'tis of the laſt importance to throw a Body of Horſe and Foot into it, that ſhall be capable to ſtop the march of the Enemy: Or elſe to leave <hi>Beaumont,</hi> and marching more to the Left, to go ſtrait for <hi>Mariembourg;</hi> in which caſe poſting themſelves at <hi>Chimay,</hi> they may incommode the Siege of <hi>Capelle,</hi> and alarm <hi>Rocroy,</hi> and <hi>Charleville,</hi> on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>If they take this laſt way, the Communication of <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beuge, Landrechy,</hi> and <hi>la Capelle</hi> will not be interrupted; as well becauſe <hi>Royanmont</hi> and <hi>Solre</hi> will continue in your Hands, as becauſe all the other ſide of the <hi>Sambre</hi> towards <hi>Mons</hi> will be free.</p>
               <p>Let them go upon what Deſign they will, if they march on that ſide, it is highly neceſſary to keep <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they take this way, St. <hi>Quintin</hi> and <hi>Peronne</hi> will be cover'd, and then the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> may draw from thence four Companies of the Guards, and the Regiment of <hi>Roche-giffard,</hi> to fortifie it, and ſo order matters, that the Succours which he may at preſent give to <hi>Monſieur de Candalle,</hi> ſhall not hinder his Siege.</p>
               <p>He may likewiſe raiſe all the Militia between <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Tiraſche,</hi> which the <hi>SIeurs de Longueval,</hi> and <hi>de Quincé</hi> may bring to him, to aſſiſt him to keep the Circumvallation of the Siege of <hi>Capelle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since the King's Return, his Majeſty has been pleas'd to explain himſelf to this effect; that if the Enemy marched towards <hi>Rocroy,</hi> then the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> ſhould follow them with all the Army, in caſe <hi>Capelle</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:42519:71"/>
ſhou'd happen to be taken, leaving at <hi>Maubeuge</hi> all the Men he can conveniently ſpare for the ſecurity of the place; and in caſe it is not taken, that <hi>Monſieur de Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalle</hi> ſhou'd follow the Enemy with a Body of two thouſand Foot, and ſix thouſand Horſe, which ſhall overtake <hi>Monſieur de Vaubecourt,</hi> towards <hi>Aubigny,</hi> with twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, and all the Militia of <hi>Champagne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the aforeſaid Debate was over, his Majeſty being preſent, has commanded me to ſend word to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> that he ſhou'd put this preſent advice in execution, and whatever elſe may be ſent to him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he ſhall judge it moſt expedient, being upon the place.</p>
               <p>If the Enemy takes the Road of <hi>Cambray,</hi> they will leave you the whole Country between the <hi>Meuſe</hi> and the <hi>Sambre</hi> open, and conſequently the Communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Capelle</hi> and <hi>Maubeuge</hi> free.</p>

               <p>FOr the entire ſecurity of <hi>Leucatte,</hi> and the better defence of the Frontiers from any Inſults on that ſide, ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of your parts have thought it adviſable to build a Fort, in immitation of that of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> called St. <hi>Ange,</hi> in the narrow Road that leads from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Leucatte;</hi> with a large Half-moon before the Gate, encloſing a ſmall Hill that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Place; as alſo a Block-houſe on an Eminence hard by, which has the like command. I have already writ of this to Monſieur <hi>D' Argencour,</hi> and have deſired him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate my Letter to you, and to joyn with you in the Survey of thoſe Places, and to obſerve whether theſe Works are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or not. But having received no Anſwer from him, I thought it but requiſite to acquaint you with the ſame thing; deſiring, that together with him and ſome others, that ſhould be well acquainted with the Scituation of the Place, you would make a ſtrict Examination into the Matter, and enquire whether ſuch a Deſign might be profitable or not; it being impoſſible for me to determine any thing ſo far off ſo well as thoſe that are upon the Spot, and know the Country.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Leucatte,</hi> I am of opinion, that if it were poſſible to throw down the Fauſſebraie from within, it were the beſt Means to ſecure the Place againſt the utmoſt Efforts of its E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having always fetch'd Earth to fortifie their Trenches from the very brink of the ſaid Fauſſebraie. Methinks Meaſures ſhould not be wanting to effect this Work, and which in my Judgment is as much or more neceſſary than any other. I deſire you to do what is in your Power, and to give me a ſpeedy Account: In expectation of which, I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Cannot expreſs my Joy for your Succeſs in your late Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at <hi>Leucatte,</hi> to force an Intrenchment, relieve a Town and gain a Battle, are viſible effects of God's Aſſiſtance; and I'm the more thankful becauſe you are choſen for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of ſo glorious an Action, advantageous both to your own Country, and the Kingdom in general. By this it appears that your Courage and Fidelity are not accompanied with leſs Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs than your Father, Monſieur <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s, have always been. The Satisfaction I hereby receive is inexpreſſible. You have nothing left to do but to make the beſt uſe of ſo ſignal a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Monſieur <hi>Noyers</hi> has acquainted you with the King's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and I am well aſſured you will not defer your Obedience with leſs Zeal than you did in your late Action, which got you ſo great Honour. This I conjure you too for a thouſand Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which I have not time here to mention. Believe, that I am and will be always, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this News has the more ſurpriz'd me, in that I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there remained any thing to be done, to ſecure it from any ſecond Attempt of its Enemies, in regard of the long time you have had to work. I earneſtly entreat you therefore to remedy this Default, in ſuch manner, that no Inconveniency may reſult from your Omiſſion; and to conſider that it is not enough to ſecure a Place, if one does not afterwards endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to preſerve it by Prudence and Foreſight.

I cannot ſufficiently commend and thank you, for the good Orders you have eſtabliſh'd in your March, for preſerving the Country, and preventing the plundering of Churches and Monaſteries. I deſire you to continue the ſame Care for the future, that your Troops may avoid the ill Reputation of Burning and Theft.</p>

'Tis hard to believe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> can be ſtrong enough to defend themſelves againſt the Prince's Incurſions into their Country, and Attack us on another ſide at the ſame time. But admitting they were enclin'd to enter <hi>Languedoc,</hi> they would certainly change their Reſolutions when they ſaw the Prince's Army in <hi>Spain.</hi> Nevertheleſs, that they may not be capable to oppoſe the Prince's Undertaking, you are reinforc'd, over and above the Regiments of <hi>Languedoc, Vitry</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar,</hi> with that of St. <hi>Aunais,</hi> and at need you may make uſe of thoſe of <hi>Rouſillon</hi> and <hi>Mirepoix,</hi> making in all ſix Regiments, and which at the head of the Militia of your Government are as good as the beſt Army we have.

               <p>I Can never enough wonder at two Expreſſes you lately ſent to Monſieur <hi>Noyers,</hi> for I could never have believed that having had ſeveral days to view the Place you beſieg'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Enemies oppoſing you in the leaſt, you could be ſo overſeen as to leave a Canal open, where the Recruits enter'd the Town without reſiſtance. I muſt confeſs, at firſt hearing this, I could not eaſily give credit to it, not being able to imagine that you ſhould not foreſee a place where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might have effected whatever they could have deſir'd. As to the other Misfortune of the two Regiments defeated, we might have been the eaſier comforted, if the former had not depriv'd us of the means; yet it is difficult to hinder my belief, that a Convoy of Thirty Horſe would not have been ſufficient to have ſecur'd the paſſage of Two Regiments of Foot. Notwithſtanding theſe ill Accidents, I am glad to hear your Reſolutions ſtill to continue the Siege in ſpite of 'em, and which, to encourage you in, Monſieur <hi>de la Force</hi> is order'd to your ſpeedy Aſſiſtance. In ſhort, you muſt needs carry the Place; and therefore for the future, endeavour to repair theſe two falſe Steps by a more extraordinary Diligence.</p>
               <p>Your Reputation and the King's Intereſt, are more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this than I can expreſs, tho' not than you can imagine. In a word, if St <hi>Omers</hi> were <hi>Oſtend,</hi> His Majeſty is reſolv'd to take it. But in truth, I muſt needs tell you, we ſhould be well buſied to ſend Troops, if you have not a more extraordinary Care to manage and to imploy 'em, ſo that the Enemies might not bring their Deſigns about without a ſtroke ſtruck.

have been reliev'd, where they have been attempted by a Perſon of your rare Endowments and Courage. I don't doubt but you have now began your Attacks, and open'd your Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſince you delay'd only till the approaches of Monſieur <hi>de la Force</hi> had cover'd you; which he now has, we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd, for theſe two Days. Wherefore there's nothing remains, but to conjure you to be very Vigilant and Diligent, and to deſire you to believe that as I am a Perſon have always valu'd and admir'd you, ſo there's none can more deſire the encreaſe of your Reputation, than myſelf, who am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Was extreamly ſurpriz'd to ſee a Courrier ſent hither from you, to deſire that Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi>'s Army might be joyn'd ſpeedily with yours, to accompliſh your Siege of St. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers;</hi> as alſo when I underſtood by the ſame Perſon, that you had not yet open'd your Trenches.

               <p>You have ſince deſir'd, that Monſieur <hi>de la Force</hi> ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach you within four Leagues, which has been granted, tho' the King had other intentions; becauſe, by covering your Siege, he would be always ready to make head againſt the Enemies where-ever they might m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, by your laſt Propoſals, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his being join'd with you, which would not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him abſolutely of any ſuch Power, but alſo put his Majeſty's Affairs into but a very ill poſture. In truth, the King has been more concern'd than you can imagin at theſe tedious Procraſtinations, and the ſad variety he obſerves in the effects of 'em. You have already ſent word two or three times, that you would open your Trenches, but ſtill there is nothing done. Such proceeding is ſo very prejudicial to the King's intereſt, in that it gives his Enemies time to grow capable of interrupting, not only this Undertaking, but alſo all other his Majeſty's Deſigns, inſomuch that it is impoſſible for me to conceal my Sentiments of it. And, having always honour'd you, as I do ſtill, I muſt needs deſire you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that it would not be at all for your Reputation, if, with an Army to back you, and another of fifteen or ſixteen thouſand Men under your Command, you could not take ſo inconſiderable a Place as St. <hi>Omers.</hi> In God's Name, Sir, be more diligent; the King's Affairs require it, and the juſt and reaſonable impatience his Majeſty may very well have upon ſuch occaſion, obliges you to it.</p>

So that over and above this, of the 50000 weight, which you ſay you reſerve for the Campaign, you'll have occaſion only for 25000, and the other 25000 you may diſtribute amongſt the Garriſons that want.

               <p>It is your buſineſs to take ſuch care of your Militia, that they may be ready to join your Regiments, as they did the laſt Year, if any occaſion ſhould offer. But once more, I cannot believe that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will attack you: Or if they will needs attempt ſuch a thing, it muſt be with ſo great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, that you may eaſily over-power 'em, as you did once before.

               <p>OUr opinion of the ſmall probability there was of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> attacking <hi>Languedoc,</hi> when they had ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful an Army of their Enemies in their own Country, was principally grounded on the ſucceſſive Accounts you ſent of 'em. But ſince, underſtanding by your laſt Expreſs, of the 14th of this Month, that they were preparing to enter the Province, the King thinks fit that you put yourſelf into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, from this very moment, to oppoſe their Deſigns. And for that purpoſe, tho' his Majeſty had intended part of thoſe Regiments under your Command ſhould ſerve elſewhere;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42519:81"/>
yet, at preſent, he is willing that you retain 'em; and, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, deſires, that you would aſſemble, as neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, the Regiments of <hi>Rouſillon, Kelas, Mirepoix, Cabrere, Orgeville,</hi> and <hi>Montbaſtier,</hi> which, with thoſe of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> St. <hi>Aunays,</hi> and the Militia that you may ſpeedily raiſe, will all together make a Body of Infantry ſufficient to reſiſt and fight our Enemies, in caſe they ſhould invade us. As for Horſe, his Majeſty well knowing you would not have enough, tho' the Gentlemen of the Country ſhould all be aſſiſting, has ſent you ten Commiſſions, to raiſe ſo many Troops more with 60000 Livres for Levy-Money. But becauſe it may be this Sum may not come to your Hands ſo ſoon as you expect, I have ſent 10000 Crowns of my own Money, upon the ſaid 60000, to the end that you may proceed in your Levies briskly, and with expedition. You may be hereby aſſur'd, that I have no leſs deſires than formerly to ſee you gain Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour over your Enemies, and that my Care of you is not more remiſs.</p>
               <p>As for the 30000 Livres you writ for about Bread, M. <hi>Noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> has acquainted me you have already had Orders for 'em on the general Receipt of <hi>Montpellier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas his Majeſty has altogether deſign'd the aforeſaid Troops to oppoſe his Enemies Intentions, if, inſtead of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Languedoc,</hi> they ſhould march towards <hi>Provence,</hi> you are deſir'd to do the like, and, as ſoon as poſſible, to join the Count <hi>d' Alez.</hi> But if neither <hi>Languedoc</hi> nor <hi>Provence</hi> ſtand in need of you, the King would have you command 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into <hi>Italy,</hi> as well to ſtrengthen the Cardinal <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi>'s Army, as to eaſe and diſcharge your own Government from ſo great a number of Men that muſt needs incommode you extreamly.</p>
               <p>As to your Complaint againſt M. <hi>de Niſmes,</hi> I am oblig'd to acquaint you he has never ſaid any thing to me of you, that you ought in the leaſt to be offended at; and if he has mention'd any thing to the Council, as Repreſentative, he has done it only by order from his Province, who, you know, have always had liberty by their Deputies to make known what they thought intrench'd upon their Priviledges. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt needs deſire you to will him no harm, but to live with him as with a Perſon I have no ordinary kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Noyers</hi> having writ to you ſo largely upon all Matters, there is nothing left more for me, but to deſire you to ſend fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Expreſſes of your Motions, and to aſſure yourſelf that

I think it would be proper that you endeavour to make this good News known to the Enemy, which being joyn'd to their Loſs of 19 Ships, at the taking of the Port of <hi>Paſſage,</hi> they may ſee, thanks be to God, that their Affairs are not in ſo proſperous a condition as they may imagine; and which the late Victory of Monſieur <hi>Weimar</hi> may evince to 'em in a greater meaſure. Furthermore, Gentlemen, the King having been inform'd, that the Enemy has taken a great Number of

               <p>I Have ſeen your Letter, which is very eaſie to anſwer. There's a great deal of difference between Surprizing a Place, and Beſieging it. If <hi>Aupaux</hi> were a Paſs of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and from which we might expect great advantages, the beſt way were to beſiege it; but, on the contrary, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a uſeleſs Caſtle, founded upon a Rock, which opens no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Country, as perhaps it might be worth while to ſurprize it; ſo a Fortnight's Siege, would not be a little prejudicial, by reaſon it would not only alarm the Enemies, but ſpend a great deal of time, that might be otherwiſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employ'd, as about thoſe Deſigns we projected before you went from hence.</p>

               <p>I Can never often enough expreſs my concern for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Trouble you are in, as well on account of the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences may happen from it, as out of a pure ſenſe of your Misfortunes; earneſtly aſſuring you, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World can prevent my having a true and ſincere Compunction.</p>
               <p>The Negligence of thoſe with whom the Dutcheſs had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted her Town, is not only to be lamented, but likewiſe not be endur'd: I'll aſſure you, the late Action at <hi>Chivas</hi> has made me pity that unfortunate Princeſs more than it is in my power to expreſs. But, nevertheleſs, at preſent, we muſt rather apply Remedies than reap up inconſolable Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
               <p>All imaginable diligence has been us'd to expedite your March; we have ſent backwards and forwards on all ſides: But, as M. <hi>Hebron</hi> ſaid, Men, not being Crows, it is impoſſible to make 'em fly. M. <hi>Emery</hi> is gone again to <hi>Lions</hi> to haſten every thing.</p>
               <p>I don't know what M. <hi>Argençon</hi> meant by ſending you word, that your Army was reduc'd to 18 Regiments: I am ſure there has been no change ſince the firſt Project, which I here ſend you. We have had ſeveral times a mind to augment it, but it was altogether impoſſible.</p>
               <p>When we added the Regiment deſign'd for <hi>Dauphine,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Royal-Highneſs's Name, it was all over and above the Complement, without taking any out. In a word, I proteſt to you, before God, that there is not one thing that were practicable, but would be done for the Dutcheſs's ſake, whoſe welfare is as dear to the King as ſhe could any ways wiſh it.</p>
               <p>For the better preſervation of her Dominions, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for the future, that ſhe reſolve to winter a Body of Men in her Country ſufficient for her defence; for otherwiſe the Enemies will be continually ſurprizing her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is poſſible for any Troops to come from <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:42519:86"/>
               <p>I won't tarry any longer upon this Diſcourſe, which, how profitable ſoever for the future, is fruitleſs for the preſent; and which will but put you in mind, that the Dutcheſs might have taken ſuch Meaſures as her Brothers ſhould not have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to promiſe themſelves the doing all the miſchief they can deſire. You are ſo judicious that you'll loſe no Opportunity to open her Eyes to her own good, when occaſion requires. Wherefore, without ſaying more, I ſhall only aſſure you of the ſincere and inviolable Friendſhip I ſhall always have for you, and that I will endeavour to make it appear by ſeveral circumſtances, that M. <hi>de la Valette</hi> means more and more to crown his ill Conduct. I have communicated to Sieur <hi>Talon</hi> a new Accident upon this Subject, which happen'd through the Imprudence and Malice of a Lady. M. <hi>de Chavigny</hi> will write you more at large. Such Deſigns I hope in God will be of no effect. I am and will be always, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>M. <hi>Longueville</hi> commands both Armies, whilſt the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> is to be in the Conclave, but afterwards each has his ſeveral Poſt.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>de la Mothe</hi> has Orders ſent him, without expecting M. <hi>Longueville</hi>'s Army, to march immediately with 4000 Foot and 1000 Horſe, to ſecure the Paſs of <hi>Eſcluſe,</hi> and when <hi>Longueville</hi> is arriv'd, you are to attempt the Relief of the Dutcheſs with French-Bravery.</p>
               <p>You muſt give out ſpeedy Orders for Magazines in <hi>Savoy,</hi> for the ſubſiſtance of M. <hi>Longueville</hi>'s Troops.</p>
               <p>'Tis abſolutely neceſſary to poſſeſs yourſelves of <hi>Carmag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolle, Villeneuſ</hi> and <hi>Cahours,</hi> and, if you can, of <hi>Revel</hi> and <hi>Coni;</hi> all which it is not believ'd the Dutcheſs will be apt to refuſe, ſeeing that without 'em you can't ſecure the Country, but with great difficulty.</p>
               <p>'Tis thought very requiſite to ſtore <hi>Cazal</hi> well with Money. But as to the 2000 Men, propos'd to be ſent thither, 'tis
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42519:88"/>
thought more neceſſary to encreaſe the Army that is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Dutcheſs, and to ſeize upon <hi>Carmagnolle, Villeneuf,</hi> and <hi>Ast,</hi> and other places, that may make the Communication entire. For this purpoſe <hi>Carmagnolle</hi> muſt be well furniſh'd with all ſorts of Ammunitions, at the ſame time that you put Men into it.</p>
               <p>As for Father <hi>Monot,</hi> the Dutcheſs muſt be very ill advis'd if ſhe does not ſend him to <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Dutcheſs have not order'd, by the Marqueſs <hi>de Ville,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> be forthwith admitted into the above-nam'd places, you muſt ſpeedily adviſe the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> that her Dutchy will be loſt without it, that ſhe may timely repair her error, and put 'em into your hands, and which I have hopes ſhe will be the more willing to conſent to, in that the places are not much to be ſuſpected, and that ſhe will ſooner chuſe to entruſt us with 'em, for their ſecurity, than to hazard their being taken by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Chavigny,</hi> being upon the place, I am aſſur'd you will together omit nothing that may advance this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Affair.</p>

               <p>The principal Point is to provide betimes for the ſecurity of thoſe Places that are pitch'd upon, fearing that the <hi>French</hi>

               <p>WE have received a Memoir, drawn by the Count <hi>de Saint Maurice,</hi> which is very good. The Contents are chiefly to provide plentifully, and to loſe no time.</p>

               <p>Monſieur <hi>Emery</hi> is provided of the Money he defired, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly upon his laſt Terms.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time that the Troops deſign'd for <hi>Italy</hi> are marching, do you and Monſieur <hi>Emery</hi> preſently go upon raiſing more Recruits that may be ready, the lateſt at the end of the Summer.

               <p>I Have received the Diſpatch you ſent me, to prevent the ill Offices might be done you by the Prince; and I can aſſure you, he has as yet made no Complaint againſt you. But to tell you the truth, having communicated your Letters to the King, his Majeſty was of Opinion, that the Caution you made uſe of towards the Prince, ſending him word you ſhould not be ready to enter the Enemies Countrey till the 15th of <hi>June,</hi> might have been of very ill Conſequence; for by theſe means you might have retarded the Performance of the whole Army, fool'd away this Campagne, and utterly ruin'd his Majeſty's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. I don't know who was the Author of this Counſel; but ſure I am, it was very ill advis'd.</p>
               <p>As to the Change of Rendezvouz which you deſire, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Noyers</hi> has writ you what is fit to be granted. But altho' you had no Money at the beginning of your Campagne, yet that would not interupt the King's Service, it being unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable to pay Soldiers juſt at their coming out of their Winter-Quarters, when they are ſuppoſed to be full of Money. His Majeſty does not intend to pay his Armies on this ſide before the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> altho' it is above twenty days, that under Monſieur <hi>Melleraye</hi> has been in the Enemies Country. Alſo the Prince is order'd not to pay his but after the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>On God's Name, Sir, make no Difficulties of this kind. But be ſure to remember, that the end of the Campagne the King will be oblig'd to diſtinguiſh between thoſe that have done well, and thoſe that have ſerv'd with ſmall Zeal and Affection. I know very well you'll be of that Number, who have ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd both their Courage and Fidelity.

We have not loſt above 3000 Men. The Enemies had almoſt all their Infantry cut off, and by the laſt Courrier we underſtand poſitively that they had 5000 kill'd upon the place.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> who was not in the Fight, has ſince joyn'd <hi>Picolomini</hi>'s Horſe with 3 or 4000 Foot of <hi>Luxemberg,</hi> wherewith they are march'd ſtreight to <hi>Verdan.</hi>

'Tis thereupon ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely the good Fortune of your Siege depends; wherefore I am aſſur'd of your utmoſt Diligence.

               <p>THis Billet comes to acquaint the Generals, that the King extreamly wonders, when he had made known to 'em ſeveral times, that the Grand Convoy was to be the laſt of <hi>June</hi> at <hi>Dourlans,</hi> which conſiſts of 40 Days Proviſion, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Cannon, and other ſorts of Ammunition, together with the entire Pay of both Armies, that they ſhould ſend to <hi>Dourlans</hi> but 1000 Horſe and 600 Foot to guard 'em. I ſhould think, if they had not ſome Divine Aſſurance of their being ſecure, they muſt needs have been extreamly unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to hazard to conſiderable a Booty. For this Reaſon the King has ſtopt their going away till <hi>Tueſday,</hi> that there may be ſent 1000 Horſe, with 1500 Foot more, to <hi>Dourlans;</hi> as alſo, another Body to march before the ſaid Convoy, till they are paſt the moſt dangerous Places.</p>
               <p>This Affair is of ſo great Conſequence both to the Siege of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One Day's Delay of the Convoy at <hi>Dourlans</hi> were ſufficient to acquaint the Enemy, or at leaſt to ſpoil ſome of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.</p>

               <p>A Man muſt be blind that is not ſenſible, that if the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had had a mind to attack the Circumvallation, they would not have done it before now; and that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if they have any ſuch Deſign, they muſt needs be guilty of an unconceivable Extravagance, which is neither conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Humour, nor the preſent Condition of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> which would be entirely ruin'd, if they ſhould once loſe a Field-battle.</p>
               <p>This once granted, which is not only certain but evident, there's no body but muſt conclude their Deſigns could not be any other than to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then the chief Buſineſs the Generals ought to have on their ſide, as we on ours, is to ſend a great Convoy, by which means the Siege of <hi>Arras</hi> may be continued without Interruption.</p>
               <p>When it is ready to ſet out, the Generals ought to ſend a ſtrong Body of Horſe to meet 'em within a League and half of the Place whence they come, that they may have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to apprehend any Danger in their Journey.</p>
               <p>If the Enemies continue at <hi>Beaufort,</hi> the Generals will do well, if they can, to cut off ſome of their Convoys.</p>
               <p>I alſo conjure once more the Generals to remember, that if they don't ſecure our Convoy, to which we can fit out but 1600 Horſe, and 9000 Foot, in vain do they labour at the Siege of <hi>Arras,</hi> which muſt be taken, whatever rate it be at.</p>

               <p>For fear he ſhould be taken, you would do well to ſend a Duplicate of what he brings by two other different Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As to the Convoy which is to march the Day after the joining, it is the General's buſineſs to ſecure it by an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Campment to the Enemies, that they may not be able to cut off the Paſs between <hi>Miraumont</hi> and <hi>Ancre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We'll reſerve 2000 Foot to guard the ſaid Convoy, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with 400 Horſe; but this would not ſuffice by any means, if we were not protected from the Enemies Army by the Oppoſition of yours.</p>
               <p>In order to the joining of Mareſchal <hi>Melleraye</hi>'s Troops, the King thinks fit, that inſtead of going to encamp, he advance half way to meet the Mareſchal <hi>Chatill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If the Enemies march off from <hi>Pas,</hi> the Generals muſt do the like, to obtain the ſame Advantage.</p>
               <p>After they are encamp'd, they muſt ſend Advice to <hi>Corbie</hi> for the Convoy to march, which they muſt take care to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by a conſiderable Party between <hi>Ancre</hi> and <hi>Miraumont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Troops will carry Proviſions for Six Days.</p>
               <p>All ſhall be punctually perform'd that is deſir'd, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Delay.</p>
               <p>Of Five Field Mareſchals that are in the Army, three muſt be left with the Duke of <hi>Chaunes,</hi> of which Monſieur <hi>Guiche</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Gaſſion</hi> ought to be one.</p>

               <p>YOU will be inform'd by Monſieur <hi>Noyers,</hi> that we are unmindful of nothing that may render <hi>Arras</hi> able to reſiſt a Siege, if the Enemies were inclin'd to attempt it. It ſhall in a ſhort time be provided of all kinds of Proviſions. Over and above Corn, we will ſtore it with Peas, Beans, Rice, Butter, Cheeſe, Salt-fiſh, Bacon, Oil and Candles. We will not alſo forget Drugs, Medicines, and old Linnen.</p>
               <p>As to the Ammunitions of War, we will leave 200000 Weight of Powder, 8 great Cannon, and 12 ſmall, over and above thoſe that were before in the Town.</p>
               <p>For your part, it is your Buſineſs to haſten the Works of the Town, and to do whatever is in your Power to maintain your Army in a good Condition.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Noyers</hi> has writ largely about what relates to the Works to the Sieur <hi>Arnold,</hi> who is upon the Place.</p>
               <p>As to the Army, the King has commanded me to acquaint you, that for the Preſervation of it, you would do well to licenſe no Officer to be abſent, if he be not ſick or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I conjure you to this Practiſe, as well for the King's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as your own particular Intereſt, that you may not incur the Character of being too Indulgent where a ſtricter Diſcipline is requir'd.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty thinks proper that you demoliſh all the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments through the whole Extent of the Circumvallation, and which we made uſe of ourſelves during the Siege, that they may be of no uſe to the Enemy; but if that they ſhould think fit to beſiege it in the latter Seaſon, the bare Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of bad Weather, might be alone ſufficient to ruine their Army. I beſeech you to have a particular Regard to what you are above deſir'd, and to believe that I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

I am aſſur'd you are ſo very ſenſible of the ill Conſequence of this Affair, that I think it needleſs to ſay more. Nevertheleſs I cannot help telling you, that if you do not take more care of the Waggons, Sutlers and Traders for the future, which come and go to and from the Camp, it will be impoſſible to ſubſiſt the Troops, and defend <hi>Arras,</hi> as the King has commanded.

               <p>IT would be to no purpoſe to have taken <hi>Arras,</hi> if we don't endeavour to preſerve it; and which may eaſily be done, providing it be well ſtor'd with every thing. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count 'tis neceſſary for the Army to continue where it is, or thereabouts, till the end of this Month, which is the ſhorteſt time can be propos'd to provide the Town of Proviſions as it ought to be.</p>
               <p>Theſe Proviſions, as it is contriv'd, cannot poſſibly come by any other way than <hi>Dourlans,</hi> ſeeing ſome of the Corn comes from <hi>Abbeville</hi> and <hi>Xaintonge</hi> by Sea; which is the Reaſon, that without great Incommodities, and waſting the Scaſon, they cannot be otherwiſe had. But as the Armies lie, this way will be the moſt convenient.</p>
               <p>Alſo, providing the Armies were at <hi>Marquion,</hi> the Convoys could not come by <hi>Dourlans,</hi> becauſe of the Promiſe to the Merchants; therefore there would be much greater Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty for the Carriages to come ſo near <hi>Bapaume</hi> than there is at preſent. And tho' they could be ſecur'd from time to time by ſufficient Convoys, yet the Sutlers coming to and fro, being very neceſſary for the Armies better Subſiſtence, would be abſolutely interrupted.</p>

But notwithſtanding, thoſe who mean beſt, think 'em the fitteſt to ſerve both Church and State. Upon this occaſion I am to inform you, that the Regulations for deputing Biſhops do not require obſerving either Place or Order. I alſo deſire you to take care, that the Perſons choſen for theſe Provinces of the ſecond Order, may be affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and eaſie to manage. But you muſt be ſure to conceal from all of 'em what I have writ to you hereupon. Only you may let 'em know that I would be glad to have his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſatisfy'd herein. In all which I deſire you to be aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to your Power, and to be ſecure.

               <p>I Cannot incline to believe that the King can receive any great Advantage by the Militia, altho' you propoſe 'em to enter <hi>Catalognia</hi> by force: And in my Opinion, you would but deceive yourſelf by truſting to 'em, who will not care to march any farther when you ſhall talk of raiſing Troops, for fear they be trapan'd as they were once before.</p>
               <p>Therefore in my Opinion, Mareſchal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Alby,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Niſmes,</hi> would do better to chuſe out of them between 1200 and 1500, who would go freely to ſerve in <hi>Catalognia,</hi> providing they might be promis'd to return about the end of <hi>October,</hi> and which ought to be faithfully perform'd.</p>
               <p>Over and above theſe Troops, <hi>Tavannes</hi> Regiment, and the 300 men of Monſieur <hi>Villeroy,</hi> muſt be ſent to Monſieur <hi>Motte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may alſo ſpare him the Regiments of <hi>Effiat, Cauviſſon,</hi> and <hi>Montauſier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Cavalry, I believe you may eaſily ſend him the nine Troops of Guards which continues with you till the end of <hi>October.</hi> Alſo <hi>Boiſack</hi>'s Regiment, who may ſerve himſelf in the quality of a Field-Mareſchal. The Regiment of <hi>Lerans</hi> may alſo be diſpens'd with.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> I am of Opinion you ought to leave there the Horſe-regiments of <hi>Anguien</hi> and <hi>Ballon,</hi> and that you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of the reſt of the Foot as you judge convenient, either to <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> or the Frontiers of <hi>Languedoc;</hi> for if you ſhould leave <hi>Rouſillon</hi> altogether disfurniſhed of Men, you might ſoon repent it; for the Enemy might eaſily ſend by Sea to <hi>Roſes</hi> 5 or 600 Horſe, which might do a great deal of miſchief in a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>The King's Will is, That you Blockade <hi>Salces</hi> up ſo cloſely, that it ſhall be impoſſible to relieve it. Which makes me think it not too much to leave two Regiments of Horſe in <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> and two or three of Foot for this purpoſe; as alſo to ſecure <hi>Lampourdan.</hi>

               <p>YOu'll know particularly by Monſieur <hi>Beſay,</hi> how well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied His Majeſty is with the Capitulation of <hi>Solces.</hi> He will alſo acquaint you how glad I am, as well for that, as your good Succeſs at <hi>Perpignan.</hi>

               <p>All that you have now to do, in my Opinion, is, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſo good Orders in <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> that the Country may reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver itſelf, and the Troops there be refreſh'd.</p>
               <p>If Mareſchal <hi>de la Motte</hi> have any farther need of Aſſiſtance of Horſe or Foot, and ſhall require 'em of you, the King would have you ſend him the Regiment of <hi>Anguien,</hi> and <hi>Contey,</hi> putting the <hi>Italians</hi> into <hi>Perpignan,</hi> in the room of thoſe of <hi>Anguien,</hi> as alſo the Regiment of Horſe of the ſame: but this only in caſe of need, or as the King's Service ſhall require. The ſaid Monſieur <hi>de la Motte</hi> not lying far off, you may hear frequently from him, and Act purſuant to his Motions. So truſting altogether to your Zeal and Conduct, I conclude my ſelf, Sir, your moſt Affectionate Servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>A Report made to the King at</hi> Grenoble <hi>by Cardinal</hi> Richelieu, <hi>in preſence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchals of</hi> France; <hi>and afterwards at</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>to the Queen-Mother, in preſence of the Lord-Keeper</hi> Marillac, <hi>upon account of the Negotiation of the Peace in</hi> Italy.</head>
               <p>THere are five principal Difficulties found in the Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a Peace in <hi>Italy:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Firſt, Regards the Emperour's reſtoring the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to his Dominions, and his ſecurity of enjoying 'em for the future.</p>
               <p>The Second, Concerning the Liberty that every Soveraign Prince has, to put whatever Garriſons he pleaſes into his Towns.</p>
               <p>The Third, About the Right the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> pretends to <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guaſtallo</hi> to <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fourth, Upon reſtoring ſeveral Places belonging to the Garriſons, with-held by the Emperour; as alſo what His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty enjoys in the Territories of his Higneſs of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fifth, About repairing ſeveral Infringements of the Treaty of <hi>Monzon,</hi> agreed between the Two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> concerning the Differences of the Garriſons with thoſe of <hi>Valtelina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe Points have been debated ſeveral times between
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42519:111"/>
the Parties, together with the Mediation of the Legate and his Holineſs's <hi>Nuncio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There have been ſeveral Conteſts about the Inveſtiture of the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> immediately demanded to have it perform'd purſuant to a Treaty, and that with Reaſon; for the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> having claim'd it ſo long ſince, by his Son, ſent Envoy, methinks the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſhould not think of deferring it longer, the previous Ceremonies being once paſt. On the contrary, the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and Spaniards offered to perform it in three Weeks after the Treaty, becauſe they would have time ſufficient for him to demand it a new. Now, although this Formality ſeem'd to be only for gaining more time, yet <hi>France</hi> has agreed to it.</p>
               <p>As to the Second Point, The <hi>Spaniards</hi> inſiſted, That the <hi>French</hi> ſhould ſo abſolutely quit <hi>Cazal,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> might never admit any of 'em into it again. To which was Anſwer'd, by thoſe that acted for the King, That their Propoſition was not reaſonable, becauſe the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had always equally entertain'd <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> when he pleas'd; that all Soveraign Princes have ever had this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and that if his Highneſs of <hi>Mantua</hi> was to be depriv'd of admitting Strangers, becauſe he was an <hi>Italian</hi> Prince, in the like manner the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ought to be excluded <hi>Milan, Naples</hi> and <hi>Scicily,</hi> being no Natives there. Alſo, That <hi>France</hi> did not require the <hi>French</hi> ſhould remain in <hi>Cazal,</hi> but only that the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſhould not be deny'd a Right to make uſe of what Garriſon he pleas'd, and which might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as well to <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> as to <hi>France.</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Spinola</hi> would by no means conſent to this Article, Affirming, That tho' he ſhould loſe four Battles, he would not do it: <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I can never look upon my Maſter's Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories to be ſafe, as long as the</hi> French <hi>have any Footing in</hi> Italy.</p>
               <p>To obviate the ill Apprehenſion he had upon this Article, It was offer'd, That the Number of the French admitted into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> in caſe the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> would pleaſe to accept 'em, ſhould be limited to 12 or 1500 Men, which might not be capable of giving any reaſonable cauſe of Suſpition; but nevertheleſs, the Marqueſs perſiſted in his Refuſal. At length the Mediators interpos'd to this Effect, That altho' it were ſaid, that all the <hi>French</hi> ſhould go out of the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi>'s Territories, and they ſhould Quit 'em accordingly, yet the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> might eaſily ſuffer 2 or 300 to paſs in ſmall
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42519:112"/>
Numbers through his Country, without being thought to know that they went to ſerve his Highneſs of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Overture was Anſwered, That over and above, that it was Infamous in itſelf, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that ſhould ſuffer it, would pretend we had infring'd the Treaty that was to be made, and thereupon tax His Majeſty with Breach of Faith; the Conſideration of both which, would be enough to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold us from any ſuch Practice.</p>
               <p>As to the Third Point, Two Difficulties aroſe: Firſt, That the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would have his Diviſion in ſuch Place as he lik'd beſt in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> altho' that Choice belong'd only to thoſe that Pay. The Second, He always inſiſted on the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 15000 Crowns <hi>per Annum,</hi> which were promis'd him the year before, with <hi>Trin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> out of the ſame Revenues which the Duke of <hi>Montferrat</hi> had, when the Right he claims to the ſaid Dominions fell to him, Whereby he would have exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded moſt of the Prerogatives the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, altho' they were altogether Hereditary. By which means, inſtead of 15000 Crowns a year, he would have had above 50000.</p>
               <p>To this the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> reply'd, That thoſe 15000 Crowns were to be paid out of the Revenues he enjoy'd when he promis'd to pay 'em. Nevertheleſs, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would never quit any of his Claims; and did poſitively aver, That if it was given any other way, the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> muſt never expect to live in Amity or Peace with him.</p>
               <p>As to the Fourth Point, The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> have demanded, That <hi>Suſa, Pignerol,</hi> and whatever elſe the King holds in <hi>Italy,</hi> might be reſtored on the ſame day they ſhould give up the Paſſes of the <hi>Griſons.</hi> It has been Anſwered in favour of <hi>France,</hi> That all that could be expected, was, That the Reſtitution of <hi>Suſa</hi> ſhould Ballance the Paſſes of the <hi>Griſons;</hi> becauſe <hi>Suſa</hi> was taken to get the ſaid Paſſes, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to march againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> who then Attack'd the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and that it was not the ſame with <hi>Pignerol,</hi> which was taken to avoid an irreconcileable War with <hi>Spain:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who Acted for the King, when he gave his Conſent to the Reſtitution of <hi>Suſa</hi> at the ſame time with the Paſſes, did ſtill inſiſt, That as he could not conſent to the Reſtoring of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> as having no Orders from the King, who at that time knew nothing of its being taken, did aſſure 'em, that the greateſt Difficulty would not be in the Reſtitution, but the manner of its being Reſtor'd.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:42519:112"/>
               <p>He ſaid, moreover, to the Legate, That being ſo far off from the King, and in ſuch an Employ as he was, he ought neither to adviſe him to reſtore, or not to reſtore <hi>Pignerol;</hi> but on the contrary, would wait His Majeſty's Orders. But never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, if all other Matters concurr'd to accompliſh it, he doubted not, but that Her Highneſs, the Dutcheſs, might eaſily obtain the ſaid Reſtitution, by means of the Queen her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that thereupon, he ſhould have Permiſſion to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint His Holineſs from His Majeſty of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Sieur Cardinal, has divers times repreſented to thoſe that were to Treat, That his Maſter deſir'd <hi>Pignerol,</hi> only to ſecure the Treaty that was to be made; ſo that the only way to incline him to ſurrender, were, to ſatisfie him about the ſame. For this purpoſe, he has always deſir'd, on the King's account, the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to enter into a League, for the defence of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> in caſe he ſhould be attack'd again. Which has been all along refus'd, unleſs, that at laſt, they ſeem'd a little inclin'd to hear him.</p>
               <p>He has likewiſe requir'd the Mediation of the Pope, and College of Cardinals, which was alſo deny'd, unleſs, that in concluſion, the Legate told him, That if he had inſiſted only upon that, the Peace of <hi>Italy</hi> had not been ſo long deferr'd. Then Father <hi>Valerien,</hi> a Capuchin Fryer, who came from <hi>Germany,</hi> on purpoſe to facilitate the Peace, propos'd, That the Emperor would oblige the Catholick League, and the Colledge of Electors, to the Defence of the D. of <hi>Mantua,</hi> if he ſhould be attack'd. But the Sieur Cardinal, deſir'd him to know from <hi>Coalta,</hi> and <hi>Spinola,</hi> if they had any ſuch Orders.</p>
               <p>After which Anſwer, the ſaid Father freely confeſs'd, That this Propoſition, was only his thoughts, without any relation to the Emperor, or his Miniſters.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Capuchin made another Overture, which was, That ſeeing we deſir'd <hi>Pignerol,</hi> only for Security of the Peace, if we had no other deſign, we might eaſily conſent to reſtore it, at the end of two years; during which, the Emperor ſhould keep the Paſſes of the <hi>Griſons.</hi> The Sieur Cardinal told him, he believ'd, the King would conſent to this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, with which he would acquaint his Majeſty, aſſoon as they were agreed about it. Whereupon the Capuchin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went to 'em, but ſoon return'd, and reported, That they would not conſent to it by any means.</p>
               <p>As to the Fifth Point, The Marqueſs <hi>Spinola</hi> ſaid, he had no Authority to make good any Infringements of the Treaty of <hi>Monzon.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:42519:113"/>
               <p>To which was repreſented, That it would neither be juſt nor reaſonable, to have two Differences at a time with <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to have ſent a puiſſant Army thither, yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn without deciding either. Notwithſtanding which, he poſitively reply'd, he would have nothing to do to repair a Treaty that bad been made by Count <hi>Olivarez.</hi> To which was anſwered, That the Queſtion at preſent, was not about Repairing the Treaty, but. Performing it. Whereupon, he promis'd in General, to Perform the ſaid Treaty of <hi>Monzon;</hi> but to ſpecifie the Infringements, he would never do it. To which was Anſwered, That we would be contented without ſpecifying 'em, providing he would ſpeedily make 'em good. To which he reply'd, That he could only Promiſe in general, that the Treaty of <hi>Monzon</hi> ſhould be perform'd, and leave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding the Infringements to another time. But it was reply'd, That would look like an Abuſe, ſince the Infringements were plain, by the Tenour of the Treaty, and to promiſe to perform it, without repairing them, would be to little or no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion is at preſent, Not if Peace ſhould be made, becauſe 'tis preferable to War for a thouſand reaſons: but if we ſhould be contented with the bare Inveſting the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> without farther Security, than the Emperor's, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Word, that he ſhould not be moleſted for the future.</p>
               <p>Alſo, If we ſhould conſent, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhould be paid the 15000 Crowns Rent, as he demands.</p>
               <p>Alſo, If it be reaſonable, the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſhould be excluded a Liberty of putting what Gariſons he pleaſes into his Towns.</p>
               <p>Alſo, If we can, or ought, to end the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Controverſy, without concluding; likewiſe, that of <hi>Valtelina,</hi> and the Treaty of <hi>Monzon.</hi> And if there be Security enough left, tho' we ſhould reſtore <hi>Pignerol;</hi> as alſo, If the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation be not concern'd, in only terminating the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and leaving that of <hi>Valtelina,</hi> and the <hi>Griſons,</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Faith.</p>

               <head>COUNSEL. <hi>From Cardinal</hi> Richelieu, <hi>after that of the Queen-Mother, and the Lord-Keeper.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ALL the Reaſons mention'd before by the Lord-Keeper, make it plainly appear, that a Peace is to be greatly deſired: For my part, I have always wiſh'd it upon the ſame Conſiderations, and have omitted nothing, in my power, to procure it. Your Majeſty, and His Lordſhip the Keeper, knows, That after the taking <hi>Pignerol,</hi> I immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd an Expreſs, to make known the Inconveniencies depended upon continuing the War, as alſo the Reaſons which might be brought for a Peace, by reſtoring <hi>Pignerol.</hi> But you both know alſo, that I had no other Anſwer, but that His Majeſty enclin'd to the nobleſt ſide, and was coming to attack <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, not to be againſt the Negotiations for Peace, returning home, I writ a Letter to the Princeſs of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> on purpoſe, that it might be communicated to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Prince, by which I deſir'd her, to further this Negotiation; hoping thereby to content both Princes, This Letter I left with the Vicar-General of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> who took upon him to carry it himſelf, that he might have an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to encline theſe Princes to a good and laſting Peace. Hereupon, he ſent twice to <hi>Turin,</hi> but could not be admitted; therefore Mareſchal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> who was acquainted with this deſign, ſent me my Letter again.</p>
               <p>The Lord-Keeper's reaſons alſo make it appear, That a War cannot be undertaken without great Inconveniencies, being a Scourge which God ordains to puniſh bad Men.</p>
               <p>But, nevertheleſs, hence it does not follow, that we ſhould purchaſe a Peace, on diſhonourable and baſe Conditions; but that we ſhould rather bear with the greateſt Afflictions a War can produce.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:42519:114"/>
               <p>The Averſion the People have to War, is not a ſufficient Motive to accept ſuch a Peace; becauſe they are uneaſie, and complain, as well of a neceſſary Evil, as of one that ought to be avoided. As, alſo, ignorant to know what is convenient, as ready to murmur at Grievances, are abſolutely neceſſary to prevent greater.</p>
               <p>He that makes Peace on diſhonourable Terms, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to maintain it long: As alſo, would loſe his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for ever, and expoſe his Country for the future, to endleſs Wars. It being certain, that no body would fear to Attack, that had obſerved the Volubility of our Tempers on this Occaſion; and the Advantages we had loſt, which were not eaſie to be regain'd. Our Neighbours alſo would ſlight our Alliance, as trifling; becauſe of our Fickleneſs, and would rather chuſe to bear with the Tyrannies of <hi>Spain,</hi> than hope to be reliev'd by Us.</p>
               <p>But to return to our Particular Caſe, In my Opinion, we cannot agree to a Peace, upon Three of the Conditions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovenamed, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, That the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhall have ſuch Diviſion of <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> as he deſires. Secondly, To exclude the French out of <hi>Cazal.</hi> And Thirdly, To Quit the Treaty of <hi>Monzon,</hi> without having the Infringements made good.</p>
               <p>I ſay, that to conſent to theſe Conditions, would be to render <hi>France,</hi> the Contempt and Scorn of all Chriſtendom, and to engage us in new Wars; which would have all the Grievances of this, and none of the Advantages.</p>
               <p>Therefore, there's nothing more to be done, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the War, for which all neceſſary Preparations are now read; and in the mean time, to think of all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable means to Negotiate a more Honourable Peace, than has been hitherto Propos'd.</p>
               <p>So we may make War to occaſion Peace, and time to come, prove a more favourable Inſtrument of effecting it, than times paſt.</p>

               <head>An Account how Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> behav'd himſelf upon the first Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of the Queen-Mother.</head>

               </opener>
               <p>AS ſoon as ever his Eminence had knowledge of the Queen-Mother's Reſolutions to diſcard him from her Service, he omitted nothing in his Power to prevent it.</p>
               <p>He humbly entreated her to conſider, that not one Minute of his Life, but he would have ſacrific'd a thouſand Lives for her.</p>
               <p>That he had always ſerv'd her, not only with Fidelity, but alſo ſuch Succeſs, as every thing fell out to her Wiſh.</p>
               <p>That he behav'd himſelf in his Perſecution ſo, as deſerv'd her Approbation, and for which all good Men commended him.</p>
               <p>That the King himſelf had declared to him ſeveral times, that the chief Reaſon of his Eſteem for him, was, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forbid the Court, he never offer'd to come near it.</p>
               <p>That ſhe was in ſo high a Condition, that her Honour, her Grandeur, and her Power with the King, took away all means from the cunningeſt People to encline him to neglect her Service.</p>
               <p>That as often as he could have the Honour to approach her, all his Care was to make known, that no body had, or could have more Zeal to ſerve her than himſelf.</p>
               <p>That he hop'd ſhe would be ſenſible of this Truth: But altho' he ſhould, for the future, be as unfortunate in being ſlighted by her, as he had formerly been happy in receiving her ſignal Favours; yet nothing ſhould prevent his being ready always to expoſe his Life, upon the leaſt occaſion, for her Safety; and at the ſame time profeſs to all the World, by Word, Writing, and all his Actions, how ſincerely and devoutly he was her Servant.</p>
               <p>All theſe Proteſtations and Profeſſions would be vain and fruitleſs, if his Heart did not go along with 'em, and hers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42519:115"/>
Sometimes ſhe ſeem'd to be ſatisfy'd, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would fly out again; which gave him reaſon to think, there was ſomething ſtill lay conceal'd from his Knowledge.</p>
               <p>He experienc'd, at his Coſts, how difficult it was to alter Womens Reſolutions, where they had been undertaken by Paſſion.</p>
               <p>He had a Proof, that their Obſtinacy, where they have no good Reaſons to alledge, will either make uſe of very bad ones, or elſe pretend to know what they don't care for giving account of.</p>
               <p>Knowing that the Minds of great People are often ſuch, that having miſuſed one of their Servants, they have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo great a Confuſion of their Fault, that they perſevere to conceal the Wrong. He reſolved to receive that by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which was due to his Innocence by Juſtice. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, this was alſo of no effect.</p>
               <p>He thought it might be with his Condition, as with an acute Ague, which Nature not being able to expel by her utmoſt Efforts, muſt be contented to wait till it were done by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Perſpiration.</p>
               <p>But he was deceiv'd in his Judgment, for he never had any Eaſe; having no ſooner got rid of one Diſtemper, but he felt another, or foreſaw a Relapſe, which often times is of worſe Conſequence than the beginning; being aſſur'd, that in caſe of Suſpicious, the laſt are moſt dangerous; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they have their firſt Impreſſions, and their Novelty beſides, to recommend 'em.</p>
               <p>A Remedy to all theſe were very eaſie and reaſonable, if the Queen would be pleaſed to conſider.</p>
               <p>He propos'd one to her ingenuouſly, and begg'd her to make uſe of it, ſince it would be both juſt and advantageous.</p>
               <p>His Misfortune being grounded only on Suſpicions ſhe had of him, and Detractions ſhe had been pleaſed to hearken to againſt him it were no Difficulty to remedy both.</p>
               <p>As to Suſpicions, the way was, to trace 'em from their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and before they had taken Root in her Mind.</p>
               <p>As for Detractions, there were two Remedies:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To ſhut her Ears againſt 'em; but which he deſir'd not at preſent, for fear he might be thought, by endeavouring to cut off the Courſe of Calumnies, to ſhut up the Way to Truth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> That it would pleaſe her Majeſty to conclude nothing againſt him, till ſhe had firſt examined into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; with Condition, that they ſhould be rewarded who
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42519:115"/>
ſpoke Truth, and they ſeverely puniſh'd, who offer'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Lye upon her.</p>
               <p>He further repreſented to her Majeſty, that if ſhe were pleas'd to exempt them from Penalty who had ſlander'd him falſſy, he was content.</p>
               <p>He ſubmitted never to enquire after their Names, who had ſo abuſed him; and to yield himſelf Convicted and Guilty, if he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d ever any the leaſt Thought to their Prejudice. Alſo, to comply with her Majeſty's Pleaſure, he would ever return Good for Evil, if they ever came to his Knowledge.</p>
               <p>He offer'd to reward any one at his own Charges, who could produce any injurious Truth againſt him.</p>
               <p>Nay, he went ſo far beyond what Reaſon could require from him, that he would give himvelf up for condemned, if her Majeſty did perſiſt in any Suſpicion, after ſhe had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the Cauſe, and given him leave to ſpeak for himſelf.</p>
               <p>He alſo ſubmitted himſelf to be more than Guilty, if in this caſe he did not retire from Court, laying down all his Offices, and freely conſenting that all he had might be confiſcate.</p>
               <p>Theſe Propoſitions were ſo juſt, that the Queen could not withſtand approving 'em: But ſtill the Difference lay in the Practice; for her Mind had been ſo engaged and prepoſſeſſed to his Prejudice, that he could never ſee any good effect from 'em. On the contrary, in ſpite of theſe Remedies, her Ear never receiv'd any Account of him, nor her Mind was byaſſed with any Suſpicion againſt him, but it immediately ſunk into her Heart, and was forthwith to be ſeen in her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>Nay, he was reduced to this extraordinary Unhappineſs, that all thoſe who were not directly oppoſite to the Cardinal, were ſuſpected. And if by chance he was well received, or kindly ſpoken of, by any one, it was ſufficient Cauſe to be ſuſpected of keeping Intelligence with him, to her Majeſty's Prejudice.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if any thing was ſpoke, by what Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that did not pleaſe her, it was immediately imputed to the Cardinal; and oftentimes ſhe put a falſe Conſtruction upon a good Meaning, to have the better occaſion to rail againſt him.</p>
               <p>Thus the Cardinal's Misfortune was without Remedy, it being impoſſible for moſt People not to ſpeak well of him, either out of regard to their Sentiments of his Actions, or a Reflection upon his good Name.</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:42519:116"/>
               <p>Some People, who were well acquainted with her Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in what concern'd the Cardinal, would never let her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the leaſt charitable Opinion of him, but would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fire her again with ſome new Artifice, cauſing a Report that would be ſure to diſpleaſe her, tho' it was viſibly falſe to every body, but which ſhe would nevertheleſs eaſily believe, ſo much was ſhe blinded by her Paſſion.</p>
               <p>The extraordinary Reſpect and Obedience he paid her, joyn'd with his incredible Patience and Perſeverance to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſerve her, were look'd upon from him as no other than Diſſimulation and Deſign.</p>
               <p>He had enough to do to repreſent to her, that Angels, the moſt confirm'd in Grace and Glory, could not be innocent, if they could be prov'd guilty, tho' it was neither in their Power or their Nature to be ſo.</p>
               <p>He often laid before her Eyes, that he ought not to anſwer for any Bodies Actions, Words, Intentions or Thoughts, but his own. But ſtill all was fruitleſs.</p>
               <p>At laſt he argu'd, That thoſe who did not care to make uſe of Means to continue their Servants, muſt needs be willing to leave 'em; and ſo concluded, that his Retreat muſt be the end of this Affair.</p>
               <p>This he grounded upon two Reaſons:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Queen not being pleas'd to give an Account of the Occaſion of her Anger and Indignation, the Effect might be delayed for ſome time; but the Cauſe not being taken away, ſhe could never be thoroughly appeaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That not reſolving to make known the Jealouſies and Suſpicions ſhe might have of her Servants, they might be convicted in her Thoughts of a Crime they were never guilty of, without having any Means to prove their Innocence.</p>
               <p>The Law never reputes a Man guilty till he is convicted; and is always ready to receive a Juſtification, where there is no poſitive Proof to prevent it.</p>
               <p>If he had been allowed this Juſtice, he had even eſteemed himſelf happy in his Misfortune; but on the contrary, he had no ſuch Liberty granted, but bare Suſpicions were both his Witneſſes and Judges.</p>
               <p>The evident Falſeneſs of their Calumnies made his Accuſers cautious not to make known their Informations nor their Perſons.</p>
               <p>As they were aſſured they could never maintain their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, they thought it beſt to repoſe their Security in their being conceal'd.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:42519:116"/>
               <p>They perſwaded the Queen, that if ſhe ſhould diſcover herſelf to him, there would be no Security for them; for he would not only know 'em by their Names, but alſo gueſs at 'em by the leaſt Circumſtance of the matter.</p>
               <p>They added farther, That his Wit was ſo piercing, that if he had but the leaſt knowledge of what they accuſed him, he would immediately diſguiſe himſelf ſo, that black ſhould ſeem white; and that conſequently, ſhe could never be able to find out the Truth.</p>
               <p>By theſe Means, all the Avenues and Ways he might make uſe of to ſhew his Innocence, were ſtopt up, and theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions had that Power over the Queen, that whatever he could ſay in his behalf, appear'd rather to be the Induſtry of his Wit than an innocent Truth.</p>
               <p>She made as much of them that told her a Falſhood, as who diſcovered a Truth. She kept all ſecret from one and the other, and both were treated alike. Which occaſion'd every one to lend his Money freely, without fear of its being enquired into the falſe Alloy.</p>
               <p>She put as great Truſt in her Jealouſies as Oracles, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd herſelf like Magicians, who are bewitch'd with their falſe Science, and which deceives 'em in moſt Points, for one that may happen to be true.</p>
               <p>The truth of one trifling Suſpicion made her conclude fifty of greater Conſequence infallible.</p>
               <p>All theſe Conſiderations tormented the Cardinal's Mind, more than is poſſible to be expreſs'd. He would freely have given his Life to have undeceived the Queen in the Deſigns and Artifices of his Enemies; and has a hundred times begg'd of God to take him out of the World in her good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>He found himſelf attacked by a Diſeaſe, and ſaw no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to free him; which made him reſolve upon a Retreat, as the only way to cure.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, he conſidered, That he who quits a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, loſes it; and who turns his Back upon the Court, gives opportunity to them that are arm'd with Hatred and Envy, to injure him unreveng'd.</p>
               <p>He knew there were ſome that wiſh'd him ill, for no other Reaſon, but that they could not endure the Proſperity of the State, and the Eſtabliſhment of the King; and conſequently, endeavoured to weaken both by prejudicing him.</p>
               <p>He conſidered alſo, that being once retreated, they would endeavour to make his moſt ſignal Services, not only falſe Steps, but Crimes.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:42519:117"/>
               <p>He thought further, that if he ſhould continue at Court, and endeavour to regain the Queen's good Opinion, by doing her all the Service he was capable of, he could not prevent ill Men from repreſenting to her, that he tarry'd only to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>He reflected, that when he had formerly been in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, he found it difficult to preſerve himſelf againſt the ill Advice was given her; but now he thought it almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to perſwade her, he ſerv'd her well, tho' he ſhould kill himſelf in the Endeavours.</p>
               <p>He thought, whilſt he was in Place, he could have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Power than to injure himſelf; it being certain, that if God ſhould give him any Opportunities to do his Country Service, it would be to no purpoſe, becauſe he ſhould be with held by ſo many Conſiderations, fearing to do amiſs and diſpleaſe, that it would be almoſt impoſſible to put any of 'em in Execution.</p>
               <p>He ſaw plainly, that tho' the Queen herſelf might be well affected to the State, yet there were a great many People that ſought to pleaſe her otherwiſe, contributing to ſome ill Event, the Blame of which might poſſibly be imputed to him; ſo that he could not hope to have any Succeſs from the beſt Deſign.</p>
               <p>This he has often been ſenſible of, by the Croſſes he has met with in the greateſt Affairs that have been concerted for theſe three Years.</p>
               <p>He eaſily perceives his Afflictions do ſo enervate the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his Body, and weaken his Mind in ſuch manner, that he ſhall not be able much longer to ſupport any Publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
               <p>Alſo, that he has ſo much to do, to defend himſelf from thoſe that torture him within, that he ſhall not be capable any longer to reſiſt his Enemies that aſſault him without.</p>
               <p>He conſidered moreover, that as he has been hitherto able to reſiſt the Enemies of the State by the Queen's Favour, he ſhall, for the future, be altogether incapable to oppoſe them, being in Diſgrace.</p>
               <p>He alſo ſaw well, that the Queen being once poſſeſſed againſt him, ſhe could not want malicious Spirits to foment and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her Prejudice, eſpecially when they found ſhe had ſo great a Diſpoſition to it.</p>
               <p>Whereas he formerly had been a Comfort to the Queen in her Afflictions, he conſidered that her Jealouſies, and their Deſigns againſt him, might now make him the Cauſe.</p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:42519:117"/>
               <p>Thus having thoroughly weigh'd all theſe Reaſons, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon his Retreat, as the only means to juſtifie his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and convince her Majeſty, that his Buſineſs at Court has always been hers and the King's Intereſt, which as their Reſpect for him oblig'd him to it, ſo that for them made him quit it.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as the Queen was inform'd of his Reſolutions, ſhe did what ſhe could to diſſwade him from it: But her Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies preventing him to think himſelf ſecure, he perſiſted in his Deſign.</p>
               <p>He repreſented to her further, that during his late Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, though thoſe that ſway'd the King, aim'd at nothing but his Ruine; yet he fear'd neither their Power nor their ill Will, ſo long as he had her to ſpeak in his Defence; and that ſhe would hear nothing to his Prejudice. But now mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were in ſuch a plight, that her Heart is ſhut up, her Mouth clos'd, and her Ears open to every body againſt him.</p>
               <p>So that finding himſelf ſlighted by her Majeſty, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to retire from the World. But the King hearing of it, would by no means ſuffer it, and endeavoured all that was in his Power to encline her to take him again into her Favour.</p>

               <p>To remedy which, there is no better way than to diſcover their Birth, and to be ſatisfy'd of their Validity, before they take Root.</p>
               <p>As to the ill Offices may be done in the World, I know but two ways to prevent their doing Harm.</p>
               <p>One is to ſhut the Ear againſt 'em; but which I cannot deſire, where the Perſons to be heard are not my profeſs'd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, for fear it may ſeem, that under pretence of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Calumnies I would obviate Truths.</p>
               <p>The other, to hear nothing, without honouring me with the knowledge of it, that I may defend my ſelf: As alſo on Condition, that they who detect important Truths ſhould be rewarded, as they that impos'd Trifles on the State ſhould be puniſh'd.</p>
               <p>I ſay the King is oblig'd in Conſcience to this; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would be impoſſible to ſerve him in his Affairs, where thoſe that are employed make ſo many Enemies, that if it be allowed to detract in private, the Malice and Cunning of the Court would not permit an Angel to ſubſiſt ſix Months.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty is ſo much the more oblig'd to grant this, in that I ſubmit to whatever Puniſhment he pleaſes, if providing he diſcover any of my Enemies to me, I am not willing to be preſcrib'd by him what Thoughts to have of 'em.</p>
               <p>Then I am humbly to conjure him, that if he intends to maintain his Authority, it would be neceſſary continually to have his Eyes open, and to loſe no time to perfect theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, unleſs he has a mind to be ruin'd.</p>
               <p>It is with this Affair as with a ſtubborn Diſeaſe, which one Medicine not being able to maſter, it may be conquered by ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Cardinal loſt the Queen's Favour by not routing the Cabals in their Birth. It is better in ſuch a caſe, to do too much than too little, providing it extend to no more than baniſhing the Court. They who have it in their Power to do Miſchief there, will make us believe they have alſo the Will.</p>
               <p>By too little, one runs a Riſque to be ruin'd; when on the contrary, doing but a little too much, without offending ones Conſcience, one ſecures ones ſelf, and there can no great Inconvenience happen, there being no greater Enemy of Cabals, than Fear and Doubt.</p>

               <p>We muſt not think to have Mathematical Demonſtrations of Conſpiracies and Cabals; they are rarely known ſo far, till they are incapable of continuing any longer.</p>

               <p>I Have not endeavoured to forget the Letter you were pleas'd to write me yeſterday, becauſe I can aſſure your Majeſty, I never took any thing amiſs in it. I beſeech you, farther, to acquaint me with all Tranſactions, and I will continue to ſend your Majeſty my different Sentiments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. What made me oppoſe your Journey at firſt, was, the knowledge I have of your Conſtitution, which might be capable of Diſorder. But, on the contrary, the great Zeal I find you have to acquire Honour by your Arms, made me eaſily conſent to it, as I do hereby a ſecond time. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, having ſeen a late Diſpatch from Monſieur <hi>Vaube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> I think it neceſſary you defer your going, till Saint <hi>Michael</hi> be inveſted, and your Troops gathered together. It is impoſſible there ſhould not a great many Changes happen, in the Deſigns one undertakes in War, becauſe Reſolutions muſt be taken upon the ſpot, according to the Mation of the Enemies.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe one gains oftentimes more by Patience, which is required in ſome occaſions, than by fighting; which is the reaſon that the French Nation being very forward, and hot in its Nature, is eſteem'd by all the World, the leaſt fit for War; when thoſe that are not ſo lively, but more heavy, and leſs fiery, are thought the propereſt for it. I humbly beg of your Majeſty, not to weary your ſelf out, nor to be vex'd at any Backwardneſs you may imagine in your Servants. I can aſſure your Majeſty, that I think myſelf, not a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd by the Letter you were pleas'd to honour me with, and am of Opinion, that if you had thought fit to chide me, which you never yet did, thro' the exceſs of your natural Goodneſs, your manner of writing, alone, is ſo obliging, that the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction receiv'd by your charming words, from the Pen of ſo great a King, would abundantly ſurpaſs the Injury.

I return your Majeſty a thouſand humble thanks, for your concern for the death of my Siſter, who, I dare ſay is happy, as well in reſpect of her being deliver'd from a great many pains ſhe endured, as for ending her days with ſo ſincere a love towards her Maker.

               <p>I Send the King the Letter which he has deſir'd, by which, he may find his Servants have not had any reaſon to Complain, as in truth, they never did, only they muſt needs be a little affected with his Majeſty's concern for them. I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Monſieur <hi>Bullion</hi> the Article which the King was pleas'd to ſend me on the Reverſe of one of his Letters, which related to what Monſieur <hi>Hallier</hi> acquainted him; That he had no Fund to ſubſiſt the Troops that ſhould arrive: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, he has aſſur'd me, and I know it to be true, that there has been 20000 Livres put into <hi>Chauley</hi>'s hands, above theſe eight days, for that purpoſe. Alſo Monſieur <hi>Servien</hi> told me, he had acquainted Monſieur <hi>Hallier,</hi> that a Commiſſary of the Treaſury, and an Ammunition Officer were ſent toward him: And, to be ſure, this Affair concerning him ſo much, Monſieur <hi>Hallier,</hi> by this time, has not been wanting to take due care. Nevertheleſs, Monſieur <hi>Bullion</hi> has ſent a ſecond Order, to diſpatch another Commiſſary, that there may be no further occaſion of Complaint. It were to to be wiſh'd, that thoſe who Command the Armies, were as ready to obey Orders for their Subſiſtance, as they are often forward to complain, when for the moſt part, their Negligence is the trueſt cauſe of their want.</p>

               <p>I Am overjoy'd to hear of your Health, and to find there is nothing to be added to the Anſwer which your Majeſty writ Monſieur <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> and to the Reſolution which had been taken. I don't believe thoſe of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> expect your Majeſty ſo ſoon, which I would not have 'em, that your Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers may ſurprize and plunder 'em out of hand.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> will, no doubt, be convinc'd by your Diſpatch, that you know more of the Matter than he: And I cannot help once more acquainting your Majeſty, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be better thought on, than what you commanded him, and no more proper way to convince him of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Deſigns.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swiſs</hi> cannot be better beſtow'd, than where your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty deſigns 'em, in <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Picardy,</hi> where I ſhall not fail to ſolicite earneſtly, Monſieur <hi>Chatillon,</hi> to employ 'em in ſomething, that may be for your Majeſty's Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>After all, I cannot but expect good Succeſs, from the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Meaſures your Majeſty takes.</p>
               <p>If my Life could deliver you from Melancholly, which I know afflicts you ſometimes, I would freely lay it down for that purpoſe. But as it cannot, I ſhall only ſtudy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, to be employ'd, as often as there ſhall be occaſion, for the greateſt, and beſt Maſter in the World, to whom I will be eternally, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Am rejoyc'd to hear by the Count, That your Majeſty was never better in health, than on your Journey; as likewiſe, by the laſt Letters from Monſieur <hi>Bouthillier,</hi> that you had taken Phyſick, whence, thro' God's Aſſiſtance, we may hope a good Effect.</p>
               <p>The Count alſo acquainted me, calmly, with the Affronts he thought he had receiv'd, complaining openly only of his Misfortune; and Monſieur <hi>Chavigny,</hi> who, he was of opinion, had power to prevent it. I told him what I thought requiſite upon the matter, and muſt needs ſay, I left him pretty well ſatisfied. I can never enough wonder at the Baſeneſs, Ignorance, or Malice of thoſe, who, as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty acquaints me, endeavour to diſparage your Deſigns. But I think it neceſſary to ſtop thoſe Gentlemens Mouths, as ſoon as poſſible, in the ſame manner as your Majeſty has done formerly ſome others.</p>
               <p>The Pope treats the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> after that rate, that it is neceſſary we take ſpeedy care about him.</p>
               <p>The Affair of <hi>Clauzel</hi> is of great Importance, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving writ largely of all to Monſieur <hi>Chavigny,</hi> I ſhall trouble your Majeſty with no more, but that I am, and will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Suppoſe the Rebels of St. <hi>Michel</hi> won't go far beyond that place, without being taken by Force, or ſurrendering
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42519:121"/>
at Diſcretion. I know the King is reſolv'd to uſe 'em with a great deal of Rigour, and I'll aſſure you, it is a matter of ſo great importance, that it is ſcarce to be expreſt.</p>
               <p>My Thoughts are, That the Officers deſerve an immediate Puniſhment, even next to death.</p>
               <p>As to the common Soldiers, the Gallies would be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for them, as the only means that ſhould be allow'd to ſave their lives.</p>
               <p>For what belongs to the Inhabitants, the Officers of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and others, the Councel of <hi>Ruel</hi> thinks they are to be divided into two Claſſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thoſe that have fomented, and favoured Duke <hi>Charles</hi>'s Party, contrary to their Oath of Allegiance to the King.</p>
               <p>And, Secondly, Thoſe that were drawn in <hi>Meré paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis thought the King might pardon the firſt Claſs, but as to the ſecond, they ought to be all hang'd, unleſs the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be too great; in which caſe, the King might pack off the moſt factious, and decimate the others, or ſend 'em to the Gallies.</p>
               <p>As for the Juriſdiction of the Parliament of St. <hi>Michel,</hi> 'tis thought beſt to add it to the Soveraign Council of <hi>Nancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay nothing of the Walls of the City, becauſe every body knows the King has already condemned them.</p>
               <p>In a word, the preſent Affairs require ſome Examples made more than ordinary; otherwiſe, we ſhall have Rebels ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that there will never be an end, and the King ſhall have no ſooner turn'd his back, but they'll riſe again.</p>
               <p>The Lord-Keeper and you, are earneſtly deſir'd to ſee, that a falſe Generoſity of ſome great Lords, may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the King in behalf of any one, where his future Welfare requires ſo great rigour.</p>
               <p>I am very well ſatisfy'd with Monſieur <hi>Bonthillier</hi>'s Conduct, and that the Poſts between the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and you, are open: As alſo, that you intend to loſe no time after the taking St. <hi>Michel,</hi> to ſend towards <hi>Metz</hi> what Troops the King orders, to keep thoſe parts free from factious Spirits, that may infect 'em.</p>
               <p>I very much wonder at the Malice of <hi>Cramaik,</hi> a Perſon you have writ me, by the King's Order, twice about. I am overjoy'd his Majeſty has intercepted his Deſigns, and eſteem myſelf not a little indebted, that he would be pleas'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me ſo ſoon of it.</p>

and vaſt Charges, to fortifie the bottom. Madam is in jeſt to think of ſurrendring this Place upon the Terms of <hi>Revel;</hi> his Majeſty will in no wiſe hear it ſpoke of; therefore it muſt be ſurrendred at Diſcretion.

               <p>I am glad that <hi>Don Felix</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>St. Morice</hi> promote the Execution of the things promiſed upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, they teſtifie thereby the Zeal they have for Madam's Security and Reputation.</p>
               <p>Having ſeen the Complaints, which you ſay the Marqueſs of <hi>St. Germain</hi> makes, becauſe he received no Reward from the King, while he was at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> nor the others who were with Madam. I cannot ſufficiently wonder why he himſelf doth not acknowledge, that it was done on purpoſe, for fear of making him ſuſpected, and to give no opportunity, to thoſe who would hinder this Eſtabliſhment, to be able to do it. If he thinks that the King's Liberality is abridged, he is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Let him take care to deſerve, and we will procure him a Reward. You will oblige me, if by a cleanly Conveyance, you will let thoſe who are concern'd, know the Contents of this Letter.</p>
               <p>I recommend to your Care the Fort of <hi>Perouza,</hi> and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Quarters, and to impart to us what things are neceſſary, ſo opportunely, that we may provide them in due time. In the mean time be aſſured, that I continue my Friendſhip, and am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>THE Advice that we have had, that the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> have Practices and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in Madam's Court, by which they are contriving great Deſigns, obliging me to inform her Highneſs, that ſhe may apply ſome neceſſary Remedies.

               <p>To that end, I ſend you a Memorial, which will let you know his Majeſty's Intentions; and that which he judges convenient for Madam to do at this Juncture, to prevent the Miſchiefs that her Enemies are preparing for her. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence ſhe has in you, the Zeal you have for the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, your Prudence and Addreſs, perſwade me, that her Highneſs will have great Regard for what you will ſay upon this occaſion, and that his Majeſty will be very well ſatisfy'd with your Negotiation.

               <p>AFter I had received your laſt Letters, concerning the impertinent Propoſals which were made to Madam by <hi>Monety</hi> and Father <hi>Michel-Ange d'Aglie,</hi> I deſired that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> ſhould go to her immediately, to let her know what <hi>I</hi> think convenient to preſerve her from abſolute Ruine. You
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42519:125"/>
will ſee the particulars I have wrote to her Highneſs, by the Copy of the Letter I ſend to you, according to which, you may act vigorouſly.</p>
               <p>The King has this confidence in you, that when there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſome unforeſeen occaſions, which may deſtroy Madam, you have Foreſight, Power, and Courage enough to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, and to prevent her from comming irreparable Faults.</p>
               <p>I do not know how Men are ſo impudent, as to dare to adviſe Madam to ſign ſomething with her Enemies, before ſhe firſt conſults the King, on whom alone depends all her Protection; and how Madam is not ſenſible, that ſuch Men, being deſirous of her ruine, that ſhe ought, by timely Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to prevent their miſchievous Practices.</p>
               <p>You muſt break up all thoſe fine Negotiations; and do it ſo cunningly, that Madam have the advantage, which her Enemies pretend to receive to her prejudice.</p>
               <p>The true means to do it, is, To diſperſe a Declaration to inform the World, That her Highneſs deſires a good and ſincere Agreement; but, that as ſhe has no other deſign, than to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſo good an end, ſo ſhe will hearken to no Propoſal, which being void of due reſpect to the Dignity of her Son, and of neceſſary Precautions for the ſafety of his Perſon, which being dearer to her than her own Life, can produce no other effect, than her deſtruction, and the ruine of her States, and good Subjects, to whoſe Preſervation ſhe will always have a particular regard.</p>
               <p>You muſt in this Declaration make uſe of the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Circumſtances of times paſt, to confirm the pernicious Deſigns of Prince <hi>Thomas.</hi> That being done, it is convenient to remove all thoſe fine Negotiations, by whoſe malice or ſimplicity, Madam, in the end, may be undone. Pray be diligent in this Affair, and be aſſur'd, that no body has a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er kindneſs for you, than, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <salute>MADAM,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THo' I wrote to you eight or ten days ago, about the bad circumſtances, in which, I think, your Affairs are in, the late Expreſs which I have juſt now received from your Highneſs, and your Commands, to give you my advice about the new Propoſals which were made by <hi>Moneti,</hi> and Father <hi>Michael-Ange de Aglie,</hi> give me an opportunity to re-aſſume my Pen: I aſſure you, that the King deſires nothing more, than to ſee you well re-eſtabliſh'd in your States, and to have a good underſtanding with your Brothers-in-law. And, that his Majeſty will be always ready to reſtore the Places which he poſſeſſes in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> into your Highneſs's hands, as ſoon as the Spaniards will, in good earneſt, do the ſame with thoſe which they hold, ſo that you may be the real Miſtreſs of them. But as the ſafety of your Perſon, and that of your Son, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> are the principal things which you ought to conſider, his Majeſty will never conſent, that they fall into the hands of perſons, whoſe whole intereſt conſiſts in their deſtruction: And your Highneſs is too well adviſed, not to ſee, that all Propoſals which are made you, without this Precaution, let them be never ſo ſpecious, are nothing but a Snare to deſtroy you.</p>
               <p>I am not amaz'd, that Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> propoſes, That you go into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and carry your Son along with you: But I cannot think that there is any body nigh you, who can adviſe you to it, without adding at the ſame time, that before you think of it, you ought to be Miſtreſs of the Citadel, as well as of the Town of <hi>Turin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this Condition, I think, you may paſs the Mountains, without taking your Son along with you; for whoſe ſafety, you cannot take too much care, to ſecure him from thoſe difficulties which may happen to him.</p>
               <p>You know, Madam, better than we, the Reports upon the ſubject of the death of the Commander of <hi>Sales,</hi> becauſe we have them only from your Parts. They ought, as I think,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42519:126"/>
make you fear the deſtruction of your Son, by the ſame way, ſo much the more, as there is a difference betwixt the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſoveraign-State, and that of a ſimple Government. You muſt be inſenſible, if you do not fear, that thoſe, who were not afraid to touch your Honour, by ſeveral Falſhoods, and Calumnies, may alſo aim at your Life, which is not ſo dear to you as your Reputation.</p>
               <p>In a word, Madam, ſince God has made you Mother of a Prince, who is the lawful Succeſſour of the States of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> you are oblig'd to do your utmoſt, to preſerve his Perſon, and his States. You will not want For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe the King offers you his; and he commanded me to write to you particularly, That, provided you will do what you can, he will ſpare nothing that may tend to your preſervation, and re eſtabliſhment, in that which you have loſt. But becauſe it is certain, that his Forces will be of no uſe to you, if your mind and prudence do not concur with his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to promote your ſafety. It is your part to take care, that you be not ſurpriz'd by bad Counſels; and to fortifie your ſelf againſt the weakneſs of your Sex, which is ſometime ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in its Conduct, not to add firm Reſolutions, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the managery of great Affairs.</p>
               <p>The Obſervations which you have ſent hither about the Propoſals which are made you, are ſo judicious to let you ſee the Cheat they would put upon you, that I praiſe God, that he has inſpired you with ſuch knowledge; and beſeech him, that he would confirm you in that deſire, which you now have, to preſerve yourſelf from their malice.</p>
               <p>I think it is very convenient, that you let thoſe Princes, that cauſe ſuch ridiculous Propoſals to be made, and your States know, that as you will be always ready to come to a good Agreement, by which your Son may remain ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſter of his States, that he may not apprehend, either himſelf, or them, to be in any danger; and that you will not hearken to Negotiations, which have no other aim, but to gain time to your prejudice, and to the ruine of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which God has committed to your charge; which they deſire to amuſe by ſuch hopes.</p>
               <p>When you have made this Declaration, I believe it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for your ſervice, to be deaf to all Propoſals that may be made, if by the firſt Article, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and your Highneſs, are not re-eſtabliſh'd in the authority that belongs to them, and if it be not permitted you to provide for both your ſafeties, by what ways you think it moſt expedient.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:42519:127"/>
               <p>Theſe two Articles being pre-ſuppoſed, I repeat it yet once more to your Highneſs, that the King is always of opinion, That you treat your Brothers-in-law with all advantages imaginable, which they may reaſonably deſire, and which, are conſiſtent with your ſafety to grant. In the extent of thoſe terms, matters may be ſo adjuſted, that thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may be fully ſatisfied; without that, your ruine is inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. This is, Madam, what I thought good to ſay, upon the preſent occaſion. Finally, I adviſe you, to oblige all thoſe who are about you, to declare publickly againſt thoſe, who ſo publickly ſeek your ruine, that a Man muſt be either blind or malicious, not to confeſs it.</p>
               <p>I am perſwaded, that there is none who will not venture his life and blood, to defend ſo good a Cauſe, and will do it generouſly, provided, he be aſſured, that you take thoſe Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which are neceſſary for your ſafety, which I in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, do paſſionately deſire, as being, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Have received thoſe Letters, which it pleaſed your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to honour me with, which imparted both the joy you teſtifie for the happy Succeſs of <hi>Cazal,</hi> and the Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of matters with your Brothers-in-law: Whereupon, I ſay, that tho' I have explain'd my ſelf ſufficiently to your Ambaſſadour, who, I am certain, has not omitted to ſend to you what I told him; yet I cannot forbear to add, That Prince <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Conduct towards your Highneſs, both by the rigour which he uſed toward thoſe, which he ſuſpected to be well affected to your Service, and by what he contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the loſs of <hi>Cazal,</hi> and by the Artifices, which he always uſed in the Negotiation, which he manages with your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ought to make you break off entirely, and prevent the Advantages, which he hopes will accrue thereby, and to make uſe of thoſe, which the Victory of <hi>Cazal</hi> gives you.</p>
               <p>I cannot conceive how they who have the honour to be nigh your Highneſs, if they are well affected to your Service, can
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42519:127"/>
ſuggeſt any other counſel, ſeeing if you liſten to ſuch a Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, you afford a notable opportunity to your Enemies to prejudice your Affairs.</p>
               <p>If they will perſwade you, that by this Accommodation, you ſecure the Tuition of your Son, and that you will receive ſome advantage by the change, which the Princes agree to make, of the Governors of the Places which they hold: I am amaz'd that common ſence doth not dictate, that in dividing your Authority with your Brothers-in-law, it will by ſo much the more be diminiſh'd, as the fear which the Subjects, and Magiſtrates ſhall have of them, will induce them rather to be on their ſide than yours.</p>
               <p>As to what they declare to you, that this Agreement may put an end to the Civil War in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> one muſt be void of judgment, not to foreſee that your Highneſs being allied to <hi>France,</hi> and the Princeſs to <hi>Spain,</hi> the cauſe of the Diviſion, and conſequently, the War ſtill remains.</p>
               <p>Further, it would be very prejudicial to the King's, and your Highneſs's Service, if His Majeſty ſhould attack <hi>Turin,</hi> while you are agreed with your Brothers-in-law: Becauſe, in this caſe, every one would ſay, That it was not your Son's intereſt which put you upon this deſign, but his Majeſty's, to poſſeſs himſelf of this place. And ſince he writes particularly to his Ambaſſadour upon this ſubject, to let you know his mind, I ſhall not ſay any thing about it in this Letter. But yet I will add, before I conclude, That thoſe who adviſe you to continue the Negotiation with thoſe Princes, and to conclude it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Union at the ſame time with <hi>France</hi> for your Intereſt, teſtify too publickly, that the fear of them, prevails more than the affection which they owe to your Highneſs; upon which account give me leave to add, That it would, Madam, have been very ſerviceable to you, that after ſo much contempt, which Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> has ſhewn of your Highneſs, if you had neither admitted him into your Preſence, nor given Audience to his Envoy: and the rather, becauſe he has raiſed ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties about ſome matters relating to your Son's, and your Intereſt; for if you had done thus, you had oblig'd him to have recourſe to more humble meaſures, to regain your Highneſs's Friendſhip, ſeeing that the happy ſucceſs of his Majeſty's Arms at <hi>Cazel,</hi> may, in time, reduce him to great extremities.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I beſeech your Highneſs, to conſider that all your Welfare, next to God, depends upon the King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and to follow the advice, he gives you, who have no
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42519:128"/>
other end, but to defend you from your Enemies, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh your Son and yourſelf in ſuch a Condition as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; which, as to my particular, I wiſh with all the Zeal imaginable, both for the Glory of his Majeſty, and your Son's and Highneſs's Welfare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The Letters which were taken in the Baggage of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Leganez,</hi> give you ſuch a manifeſt proof of the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity with which Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> ſeemed to treat with your Highneſs, that you muſt either be blind, or your own Enemy, if you do not believe, that all his Treaties with you will be of the ſame nature, unleſs he come over for the King, and wholly deceive the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

This Negligence affects me ſo ſenſibly, that I confeſs I am out of Patience, and I cannot tell what Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have of Madam's Intentions after ſuch an extravagant Trick. I conjure you to repreſent to her the Prejudice ſhe does to the general Affairs, and to her own in particular, by that ill Conduct, which is enough, either to ruine the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of <hi>Turin,</hi> or at leaſt, to give this Advantage to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to take another Place without much Reſiſtance, while

               <head>LETTER CCXXXVIII. <hi>To</hi> James, <hi>King of</hi> England. <hi>Concerning the Marriage of the P. of</hi> Wales.</head>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THis is not the firſt time that I am ſenſible, that great Kings often conceive things according to their great
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42519:129"/>
Qualities, and not as they are in themſelves; that they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie mean things by the Eſteem they have of them, and thoſe whom they honour by their Benevolence cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable. The Letter with which your Majeſty was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to honour me, confirms me in this Truth; becauſe it lets me ſee, that I have ſo much Merit in your Eſteem, as in effect I have Admiration of thoſe great and rare Qualities which are in you: They are, Sir, ſo ſhining, that if by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them I have no Advantage above the reſt of the World, who may be ignorant of them; yet at leaſt I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that few admire them ſo much, and none can do it more than I. Reſpect has always induced me, in the Service of the King my Maſter, to anſwer your Majeſty's Expectation in accompliſhing the happy Alliance, projected betwixt the two Crowns. It was no difficult thing; for I ſatisfy'd my Deſire, and did my Duty at the ſame time: Becauſe that as on one ſide, the King never thought but of proper Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to give you an opportunity to oblige the Hearts of your Catholick Subjects with new Chains, which you have already gain'd; your Majeſty on your part, hath of your own accord granted that, which being deſired for their Good, was alſo principally for your Advantage. If they receive much Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from your Majeſty, you will thereby gain a Glory, the more ineſtimable, becauſe it will be eternal.</p>
               <p>It is a thing, Sir, not to be at all doubted of; becauſe, that as the firſt Water of a running Stream is ſufficient to let us know, that its Channel is not ſtopt, ſo it is enough to know, that your Majeſty, whoſe Bounty is inexhauſtible, hath once engaged to be gracious to your Subjects, to be aſſured that they will receive continual Effects of your Benevolence; and conſequently, your Majeſty will more cloſely unite thoſe Hearts which are already yours.</p>
               <p>Heaven, without whoſe Concurrence, nothing can attain to Perfection, hearing the Prayers of ſo many Creatures who depend upon your Majeſty, will unite thoſe two Monarchies with an indiſſolvable Knot; that as their joint Forces have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made the <hi>Levant</hi> tremble, ſo they will now ſtrike Terrour in all their Enemies, and diſſipate all the Efforts of thoſe who deſire to hinder that Happineſs that they may effect in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.</hi> I beg it of God with all my Heart; and that he would beſtow upon your Majeſty all thoſe Bleſſings, which ſuch ſingular Qualities, which concur in your Perſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. I am eternally, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>His Majeſty is as well ſatisfied with the laſt, as he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the two former.</p>
               <p>Let the Pope do what he will, he can never compromiſe, that Cardinal <hi>Anthony</hi> ſhould not be Comprotector of <hi>France,</hi> ſince he has deprived Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> of this Charge for that purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:42519:132"/>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Anthony</hi> accepted of it by the conſent of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without which, neither the King nor he had ever thought of that Affair; Cardinal <hi>Barberini</hi> alſo ſhew'd no diſlike of it to his Brother.</p>
               <p>The Pope may, by his Authority and Violence, hinder Cardinal <hi>Anthony,</hi> his Nephew, from the Exerciſe of this Charge; but as he cannot do it with Reaſon, he will never do it with the King's Conſent, who being ſenſible, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, the Pope and his Family are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of ſo bad Counſel, will be pleaſed very much to oppoſe it, becauſe of the Reſpect which he owes to the Church, and the Affection to his Holineſs's Family; which is ſuch, that his Majeſty gives Orders to the ſaid Embaſſadours to hinder any Preconiſations to be made in the Conſiſtory of the <hi>French</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, till it pleaſe his Holineſs to permit Cardinal <hi>Anthony</hi> to make them in executing his Office.</p>
               <p>The Embaſſadours ſhall give this Anſwer to the Pope and to Cardinal <hi>Barberini,</hi> with all Compliments imaginable; but with as much Reſolution not to depart with the Comprote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Cardinal <hi>Anthony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſhall alſo tell Cardinal <hi>Barberini,</hi> That his Majeſty would find it very ſtrange, if he ſhould have any Umbrage of the Comprotection of <hi>France,</hi> in the Perſon of Cardinal <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony;</hi> becauſe he only deſired he ſhould Exerciſe that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to let the World know the particular Affection he has to the Pope's Family, and to have more Ways to keep the two Brothers united, when their Intereſts ſhall more require it.</p>
               <p>They ſhall alſo particularly make known to Cardinal <hi>Anthony,</hi> the Satisfaction the King has in him, and ſhall give him Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Protection and Aſſiſtance in all things.</p>
               <p>They ſhall communicate to Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution the King takes to put an end to the Preconiſation of the Conſiſtorial Benefices, till the Pope, putting an end to the Prohibition which he has given Cardinal <hi>Anthony,</hi> repair the Injury, which, by that means, they would do <hi>France:</hi> And ſhall let him know, That it is not that his Majeſty diſlikes that he ſhould continue to Execute the Office of Comprote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, but only that he might not give this Advantage to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to think that <hi>France</hi> yields to their Deſires.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, if his Holineſs, coming to himſelf, will give his Majeſty that Satisfaction which Juſtice and Reaſon require, permitting Cardinal <hi>Anthony</hi> to Exerciſe the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Office of Comprotector, for whom it doth not ſeem that the Pope has loſt his Cauſe, and the King has gained
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42519:133"/>
his; yet his Majeſty thinks it good, that the Embaſſadours conſent to this following Expedient, which is, That it be a Month before Cardinal <hi>Anthony</hi> execute the Functions of his Office in the Conſiſtory, upon condition, that, from that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Holineſs paſs his Word to the ſaid Embaſſadours, That, from that time, he ſhall agree, That he Execute his Office, without having a new Licence from his Holineſs.</p>
               <p>This Overture has not been made to Cardinal <hi>Bichi,</hi> that the Embaſſadours may be able to manage it ſo much the better, becauſe they only are acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>If the Pope is not ſatisfied things ſhall be left in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned condition, without any Preconiſation of the <hi>French</hi> Affairs in the Conſiſtory, yet Mareſchal <hi>Crequi</hi> ſhall return by the way of <hi>Venice,</hi> giving his Holineſs a Teſtimony, That the Reſpect his Majeſty has for the Church is ſuch, That, notwithſtanding former Paſſages, the King has not failed to give him order to Negotiate the Pope's Affairs at <hi>Venice,</hi> as tho' his Majeſty had not been diſobliged. In taking leave of his Holineſs, the ſaid Mareſchal, as well on the King's as his own part, ſhall make him all the Compliments imaginable; aſſuring him withal, That his Majeſty will never change his Reſolution concerning the Comprotection, being by no means able to endure, that any other, beſide Cardinal <hi>Anthony,</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe that Office.</p>

               <p>AMong other Diſpleaſures with which the Piety of the King is afflicted, as he beholds the Miſeries the Church ſuffers, by the Diviſion and Diſcord of Chriſtian Princes, his Majeſty has been ſenſibly diſſatisfied with the evil Proceedings of ſome of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters toward your Holineſs, and with the little Reſpect which was paid you by one of thoſe who are the moſt obliged to honour you. I cannot enough admire, that he has ſo far forgot himſelf, as to have uſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Complaints, and ſome leſs decent Terms, inſtead of Praiſes and moſt humble Thanks, which are due to the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42519:133"/>
ſingular Goodneſs and Wiſdom of your Government. Your Holineſs has always appeared ſo manifeſtly to deſire the Peace of Chriſtendom, and to appeaſe the Differences which might trouble it, that there is no body, if he be not prejudiced with Paſſion, but muſt acknowledge, that you have omitted nothing, that you thought convenient, to promote ſo good a Deſign. If, amongſt all thoſe who are compell'd to behold this Truth, ſome do profeſs the contrary, any Man may plainly ſee, that it is Intereſt alone which makes them ſhut their Eyes at Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and open their Mouths to ſpeak againſt the Sentiments of their own Conſcience. It ſeems, that God has permitted things of this nature, which are lately paſs'd, that your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may receive new Teſtimonies of the Zeal of the moſt pious and the greateſt-Prince of Chriſtendom, who will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways think it a ſingular Glory to promote your Intereſt, and to partake of the Cares and the good Reſolutions your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs has always had for the Advancement of Religion, and the Eſtabliſhment of the Publick Tranquility; to which, he thinks, it will not a little contribute, to let the World know, the Deference which is due to the Holy Chair, and to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Pope, of ſuch rare and ſingular Vertues as your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. As for me, moſt holy Father, I ſhould think my ſelf altogether unworthy of the Honour I have in the Church, and the Favours I receive from ſo vertuous a Prince, as he is, to whoſe Service I am devoted with all manner of reſpects, if I did not earneſtly deſire that Peace which your Holineſs and his Majeſty ſo paſſionately wiſh for Chriſtendom, which has hitherto been diſturbed by thoſe who deſire to appear contrary to one another. I hope, that God will make this Truth more manifeſt to the World, and that your Holineſs will have reaſon to confeſs, that, as the King gladly makes uſe of all his Power to the Glory of God, the Good of the Church, and the Publick Tranquility, he will loſe no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to give you Proofs of his ſincere Affection for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of your Family: which, according to his Intentions, and your Holineſs's Merits, I will always endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, as it is my Duty, who am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Have this great while ſtruggled in my ſelf, if I ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to your Holineſs the great Miſchiefs which <hi>France</hi> ſuffers by reaſon of the Delays, which for ſome time have been made uſe of in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Expedition of the Bulls of the Biſhops, nominated to your Holineſs by his Majeſty; but at laſt, the Salvation of Souls, the Reputation of your Holineſs, and the Fear of my being accountable to God, if I do not inform you what is ſaid upon this Subject,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42519:134"/>
have prevailed with me to take Pen in hand, to beſeech you to prevent this great Evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> am ſure your Holineſs will judge, that it is reaſonable, that you concur with the great Care that the King takes, to make choice of the beſt Subjects of his Kingdom to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to Biſhopricks; and that by this means, thoſe who are deſigned for that Office, may make uſe of the Talents that God has given them, to the Salvation of Souls; he would not ſee by the Vineyard's ſide many unprofitable Labourers, becauſe they are not introduced by him who ought to ſet them at work; the great Fruit that they reap, who have been lately promoted to ſuch Offices, gives occaſion to Men to complain of the Miſeries of the Church, being by ſo much the greater, becauſe little Obſtacles ſtop the Current of thoſe great Favours, which it expects from your Hands.</p>
               <p>As the Church cannot be divided from the Authority of your Holineſs, ſo <hi>France</hi> would not be ſeparated from your Goodneſs, which ſhe is ſenſible is ſo great towards her, that ſhe will always think herſelf as aſſured of that for which ſhe is purely dependent, as of that which ſhe may expect from Juſtice. It has always been an ancient Cuſtom of <hi>France,</hi> to take Informations of the Life and Manners of Men before the Biſhops. The King might pretend, that they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in thoſe Terms. But if the Deſire that he has to ſhew, that he will pay to the Holy Chair as much Deference as he can, without diminiſhing the Rights and Dignities of the Crown, induce him not to hinder, that thoſe nominated to Biſhopricks, who ſhall have more Conveniency to take In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations before the Nuncio's of your Holineſs, may make uſe of this Liberty, provided that thoſe, who, according to the ancient Cuſtom of the Realm, ſhall be inveſted before <hi>French</hi> Biſhops, may obtain their Bulls as readily, as tho' they they had applied themſelves to your Nuncio's. Your Holineſs ſhall have that, which your Predeceſſors never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of thoſe who have hitherto poſſeſſed the Crown, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have wink'd at it upon certain occaſions; as the ſingular Virtues which were remarkable in your Perſon, while you were in this Kingdom, cannot be blotted out of our Memory. I am alſo certain, that your Holineſs doth ſo well remember what you ſaw practic'd there, that you need but have recourſe to your Zeal, to promote the Welfare of <hi>France;</hi> the Knowledge that you have of what has been always obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there, is ſufficient to make you acknowledge the Juſtice of her Deſires. If you conſider alſo, that Informations made
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42519:135"/>
before <hi>French</hi> Biſhops, cannot be refuſed, without doing a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Prejudice to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who could not receive them without judging of their Probity, which was ſo well known, that there was no room to doubt of the Validity of what paſs'd before them. I am ſure, that Mens Souls will ſpeedily receive of you that Aſſiſtance which they hope for; and that your Holineſs, by opening the Mouths of thoſe who expect that Liberty to inſtruct the People, which is altogether neceſſary, ſhall ſtop theirs, who cannot but complain of the Difficulties which have hindred them from receiving the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of your Power and Goodneſs. This is that which I beg of you in all Humility, deſiring of God that he would add many Years to your Life, many Bleſſings to your Houſe, and as much Happineſs to your Perſon, as is deſired by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>THE Joy that I have for the good Underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Holineſs and his Majeſty, will not ſuffer me to be ſilent; and I think I ſhould be wanting to myſelf, if I ſhould fail to teſtifie it to your Eminence: That Moment that this Letter ſhall come to your Hands, it will give you a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Proof of my Affection, and Deſire of the Welfare of your Family, whoſe Intereſt you hazard ſo much by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of the Promotion, that <hi>I</hi> could not but inform you of it. I do not conſider this Affair by the Miſery which may happen by the Death of his Holineſs, (to whom <hi>I</hi> earneſtly deſire length of Days) becauſe the greatneſs of the Loſs you would have by the Death of ſo good an Uncle, ſtifles in my Thought the Conſideration of all its Conſequences. You muſt be blind not to ſee, that this ſhaking of your Houſe would be a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of its Ruine; but you loſe ſo much from this very Moment, by not making the Promotion, and fail to take Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages ſo important for you, and the Church, that it is impoſſible to conceive the Reaſons which have retarded it hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto. Thoſe who envy the Grandeur of your Family, and deſire its Depreſſion, have this Satisfaction, to live in hope to ſee that which they deſire, to your Diſadvantage; and inſtead of fearing your Eminence, if this Promotion were made, you
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42519:136"/>
give them opportunity to deſpiſe you, by the Belief that you will not lay hold upon an occaſion, which may put you in a Condition, not only not to fear them, but to have no need of them; my Endeavours after the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> which are dearer to me than my own Life, would not permit me to give you this Counſel, after the execution of which, you may have leſs Conſideration for the Crowns; becauſe you would not have ſo much need of them, if the Intereſts of the Church, and all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> which the King prefers before his own, did not concur with yours. The Ambition of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> is too well known to the whole World, not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that they have no other Deſign, than not only to make Popes which may be favourable to them, but who may ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely depend on them, as to conſider the Deſires of <hi>Spain</hi> as the Rule of the Actions of the Holy Chair; and you are too quick-ſighted as not to ſee, that if you do not fill thoſe many Vacancies in the Conſiſtory, you will not be ſtrong enough to hinder them from obtaining their Ends; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which, the Church will be involved in a Servitude both ſhameful and intolerable, if the Contempt that you have of yourſelf, hinders you from a due Conſideration of an Affair of ſo great Moment to your Family: The Publick Intereſts do not ſuffer you to do ſo, the Peace of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> the Glory of God, and the Liberty of his Church, oblige you, upon pain of anſwering before the Tribunal of Heaven, to contribute your utmoſt to their Advantage, ſeeing there are no Reaſons able to counterpoiſe thoſe powerful Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. I cannot imagine that you ſurmize, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects nominated by the Crowns are not agreeable, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>I</hi> know, and dare anſwer, that thoſe who apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>France,</hi> will paſſionately embrace the Intereſts of your Family; and that though they ſhould not do it, this Conſideration is too weak to divert them from ſo important a matter. In a word, my Lord, the matter in diſpute, is, ſo to ſecure the Eſtabliſhment of your Houſe, that it may not be ſhaken, or fall into Contempt or Ruiune.</p>
               <p>The matter in diſpute, is, Either to leave <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in Confuſion, or to put yourſelf in a Capacity effectually to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote its Peace, inſtead of being contented with inſignificant Wiſhes for ſo good Ends: The matter in diſpute, is, Either to abandon the Church of God, or to recover, and confirm at the ſame time, its Renown and Grandeur. Whereas now, thoſe who envy your Happineſs, from their Height look down upon you: This Promotion will be no ſooner made, but they
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42519:136"/>
will be compell'd to lift up their Eyes, to ſee you in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very different from your former; whereas many judge by Appearances, which often deceive, that there is Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Weakneſs in your Conduct: Blindneſs, if you do not ſee the Condition you are in, and Weakneſs and an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of yourſelf, if you will not make uſe of thoſe Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which you have in your Power: Some will commend your Prudence, others will admire your Power, and you will be eſteemed by all Men for your Ability in ſecuring your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and the Intereſts of the Church, which are much dearer to you than your own. If any one blame me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I think I ſee a-far off, which they think your Eminence doth not judge to be ſo nigh; give me leave to ſay, That the Publick and your Intereſts are always ſo preſent, and ſo much affect me, that <hi>Paris</hi> is not ſo far from <hi>Rome,</hi> but I can ſee clearly what Matters of Importance happen in both places. I know very well, that his Holineſs's Chair is the Seat of Wiſdom, principally in the Life of ſo great a Pope. But as it is with Men in that which moſt concerns them, as with thoſe who cannot ſee, becauſe they are dazled with the Light which is too nigh them, I am ſure your Eminence will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, if I preſume in this thing to be ſo clear-ſighted, as to conjure you to prefer my Sentiments, before thoſe which you eſteem to have had hitherto. I conjure you, by the Care which you ought to have, that the ſucceeding Actions of his Holineſs anſwer the Luſtre of thoſe that are paſt; ſo that it is with the Judgments of the World, as with thoſe of God, who judges Men by their laſt Actions: Men would not eſteem the Life of ſo great a Pope, being deſtitute of Wiſdom; becauſe this Virtue would ſeem not to have been the Motive of his laſt Thoughts. Finally, I conjure you, by the Deſire you have to prolong the Pope's Days, whoſe Life probably will be the more aſſured, the greater cauſe of Contentment it ſhall have; which I wiſh him ſo heartily, that I beg of God an ample Effuſion of his Bleſſings upon his whole Houſe, and upon your Perſon, to whom I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

As to my particular, I would contribute my utmoſt to this end, but thoſe with whom we have to do, are ſo far from it at preſent, that they have depriv'd us of all hopes of it; but let what will happen, I will always honour your Highneſs, as it is my duty, and will teſtifie to you that I am more concern'd for your Intereſt than mine own, having no greater paſſion than that to ſerve you, and to let you know by real effects that I am as much as can be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

It is long ſince I earneſtly deſir'd to ſee things in the condition they are now in, for which I praiſe God with all my heart; and tho' I do not at all doubt, but that things were manag'd by his Inclination, as you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to write; it is alſo certain, that your Perſwaſions were very efficacious to this purpoſe: which is the reaſon, that by the conſent of the whole world, you merit more Glory, than my Pen is able to expreſs: He will reap this advantage by it, That renewing a ſincere and good underſtanding with the King, he will receive all the teſtimonies of affection which he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of his Majeſty; and you, Madam, all the marks of that ſingular eſteem which he has for your Perſon, and of that tender love he has had for you many years.

               <p>THE Sieur <hi>Bernet</hi> has given me the Letter with which your Highneſs was pleas'd to honour me, and has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me your belief, which is of no ſmall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I cannot be ſufficiently amazed at the evil diſpoſition of the Princeſs of <hi>Carignan,</hi> and at the ſcandalous Diſcourſe which is reported ſhe makes uſe of to your Prejudice: I will not conceal that ſome Noiſe of it has reach'd the King's Ears. I omitted nothing of my Duty to let him know the Falſhood of ſuch Calumnies, which have no bad impreſſion upon his mind. I confeſs, Madam, That thoſe who will be glad to advantage themſelves by blemiſhing your Virtue, ſtrive to colour their Calumnies with ſo many circumſtances, that they
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42519:142"/>
have no foundation; yet they have ſome falſe appearance in their malice, and I ſhould not be your Highneſs's Servant to that degree that <hi>I</hi> pretend to be, if by my Obedience to what you are pleas'd to command, to write to you what <hi>I</hi> think proper for your Service. <hi>I</hi> did not tell you, that the firſt and principal thing you ought to do, in my Opinion, is, ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port yourſelf, that your Enemies may not be able to miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret any of your Actions: It will be, Madam, a very eaſie thing, and by that means, you will prevent that at any time none do you any bad Office with the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and this Proceeding will be no ſmall help to the King, in the Deſign which he has always had to aſſiſt you upon all Occaſions. This being done, Madam, as <hi>I</hi> do not at all doubt of it, becauſe it wholly depends upon you, your Highneſs need be afraid of nothing, let the Endeavours of your Enemies againſt you be never ſo powerful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> am of your Highneſs's mind, That the Deſigns of thoſe who would blemiſh your Virtues by their railings, have a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tendancy than at firſt ſight they ſeem to have; but <hi>I</hi> hope God will preſerve your Husband longer than thoſe Men; and <hi>I</hi> can aſſure you, that if ever <hi>Spain,</hi> by any ones Inſtigation howſoever, undertake any thing againſt him, your Highneſs, and the Children that it has pleas'd God to give you both, that the King will protect you ſo powerfully, that ſhe ſhall receive nothing but ſhame by her Enterprize.

I will only tell you, Madam, that the King was ſenſibly affected with the News; and the ſame Hour he heard it, he diſpatched this Gentleman to let you know his Concerns for it, and to bring back the Conditions of his Health, for which he is in much Pain. I do not tell you, Madam, the Tenderneſs and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which it pleaſes his Majeſty to declare to me he has for you upon account of this Sickneſs; becauſe, beſides that the Embaſſadour will not fail to make it known to you; as

As to my particular, Madam, I beſeech your Highneſs to believe, That I will always eſteem myſelf extreamly happy, to employ the Remainder of my Life, to ſecond his Majeſty's Intentions for your Advantage; and to let you know, by my Actions and Services, that no body doth, and will honour you with more Sincerity than myſelf; nor is more truly what I always will be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I Am ſo afflicted at the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s death, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to expreſs it. This accident has ſo much the more affected me, becauſe it has ſurpris'd us when we thought leaſt of it: I have nothing to add to that which I wrote two days ago, upon the ſubject of his Highneſs's ſickneſs, only, that as I believe, that Madam ought to make it her principal Aim, to hinder her Brothers-in-law from entring into her States; I think alſo ſhe ought to relux that great and juſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had in depriving them of their Poſſeſſions. Upon this ground, I think, ſhe may let the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Savoy</hi> know, that ſhe will ſuffer him to enjoy what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him, and mildly diſpoſe him to live at <hi>Rome,</hi> without pretending to return into <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is thought that Madam may reſtore him <hi>Maſſerati,</hi> whom the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> has put in Priſon, and that this Man carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him this news to <hi>Rome,</hi> may diſpoſe him, of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, to do what Madam deſires. Whether it be by this way, or any other, it is altogether neceſſary to ſtand upon theſe Terms. We find ourſelves much troubled to nominate the Perſons Madam ought to make uſe of; you know Father <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi> it is hard to paſs him by in the conditions he is in; it is alſo difficult to have any confidence in him.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs of St. <hi>Morice</hi> is a very good Man, he is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether joyn'd to Father <hi>Monod,</hi> he was as you know, Maſter of the Horſe to Prince <hi>Thomas.</hi> I fear that Father <hi>Monod</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make Count <hi>Philippes</hi> perſwade Madam that it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing to her, whether or no the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into her States. I do not tell you this without reaſon, having ſeen ſome Men who have already perceiv'd that the Sentiments of ſome of that State tend that way: and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſuch Men can be no other but to ſtrengthen and fortifie themſelves againſt Madam upon all occaſions, when ſhe doth
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:42519:149"/>
not Act according to their deſires, and by this means to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en her Authority. You muſt, above all things, have a care of ſuch Council, by which, neither Madam's nor her Childrens life will be ſecure. Whatever Council her Highneſs is pleas'd to take, it is reaſonable ſhe ſhould impart it to the King, and ſo, that thoſe who are choſen, may know it was by his Majeſty's Approbation. We will ſend you by the firſt, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Henry</hi> the Second govern'd himſelf upon the like Occaſion, upon the death of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Grand-father.</p>

               <p>It is thought, that if Madam ſet at liberty the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Domeſtic, which his late Highneſs had Impriſoned, and ſend him to carry this News, it will be a double Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make him comply with Madam's deſires.</p>
               <p>It is a thing of Importance, that Madam give ſome eaſe to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42519:150"/>
her Subjects: But if, this be impoſſible during the War, it is neceſſary that ſhe declare, that ſhe only expects a Peace, to give them a Teſtimony of the Clemency of her Conduct.</p>
               <p>Madam's great Forefight makes me believe that ſhe will not ſuffer herſelf to be excell'd by any other of her Sex who have had the Adminiſtration of a State. Yet, after ſhe has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd her Goodneſs, as ſhe ought, to all her Subjects, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether neceſſary that ſhe uſe Force and Vigour againſt thoſe who ſhall contradict her Will, and are guilty of Crimes againſt the State.</p>
               <p>For Inſtance, If any of her Brothers-in-law ſhould preſume to enter into her States, ſhe muſt ſhut the Gates in all places, and abſolutely deny them entrance, the Security of Madam and her Children, the Peace and Tranquility of her State depends ſo abſolutely upon this Point, that if ſhe neglect to obſerve it, upon any pretence whatſoever, we can foreſee nothing but miſchievous Conſequences from ſuch a Neglect. If any of the Governours or principal Officers be known to be Adherents to thoſe Gentlemen, they muſt be changed, without giving them time to put their wicked Deſigns in execution: and if any one fail, he muſt be ſeverely puniſh'd.</p>
               <p>In a word, By how much the more Madam's Sex is eſteem'd to be weak, ſhe ought to govern with ſo much the more Force and Vigour, that a good Diſcipline may be kept in her Government.</p>
               <p>I do not ſpeak of the Deference which Madam ought to have to the King's Advice, becauſe ſhe is too wiſe, not to know, that under God, all her Safety depends upon him. As ſhe muſt have a particular care to regulate herſelf by the Counſels that are given her by a Perſon ſo concern'd for her welfare: thoſe, of his Majeſty's Friends, who are about her, muſt think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to govern themſelves with Modeſty, that all her Highneſs's States may know, that the only Deſign of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is purely to Aſſiſt Madam, for her own ſake, without any other Pretence than her Advantage, and the Security of her Childrens States.</p>
               <p>This Circumpection is altogether neceſſary to take away all Pretence from thoſe who, being Adherents of <hi>Spain,</hi> would make ſeeming, that the proper Intereſt of Madam and her Children ſhould oblige her to ſeek for a Counterpoiſe from thence, to oppoſe the Pretence that <hi>France</hi> may have to her Prejudice. I do not take notice of the care you muſt have to pleaſe Madam, becauſe it is a thing ſo well known, that no body who is employ'd at her Court can fail of that Duty.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>MAdam may be aſſured, that if the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> be in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> there is no ſafety for her, or her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Let Men ſay what they pleaſe, ſhe ought to ſuſpect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body, who ſaith the contrary. If the ſaid Cardinal has had the Impudence to ſpeak to the prejudice of Madam's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, while the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> lived, what is it he will not do now?</p>
               <p>It is not doubted but at firſt he will ſay the quite contrary, and tell Madam that he only comes to ſerve her: but this is his way to get Footing, and to ſtrike the Blow afterwards.</p>
               <p>It is much to be feared, as you repreſent, that Father <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> correſponds with him: and if ſo, if he have any influence over Madam, he will do her a great deal of miſchief. He is a Man full of Artifice, who will watch his opportunity, and change his Mind ſo many ways, that at laſt he will make her fall into ſome Snare; and without doubt, he will, in the end, ruine Count <hi>Philippes,</hi> if he have not a care of him.</p>
               <p>We fear from this moment, either Poiſon or Daggers; and beſides, Madam's loſs in loſing her Creatures, it will rebound upon her, and afterwards infallibly cauſe her Ruine.</p>
               <p>If Madam's Government be weak in the beginning, it will end in ruine; if it be ſtrong, all things may be remedied.</p>
               <p>Her Strength muſt appear, by oppoſing the Cardinal of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>'s coming, and ſo effectuly oppoſing it, that if he enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the State, Madam muſt conſent that the King order him to be arreſted and brought into <hi>France,</hi> where he ſhall be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Perſon of Quality. After ſuch an Action, it is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's Duty to ſee thoſe who are reaſonably ſuſpected to her: and if God give her the Grace to continue the Suſpicion, which
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42519:151"/>
you write ſhe has had of Father <hi>Monod,</hi> it will be a particular ſaving Grace for her: For, to tell you the truth, as you are very ſenſible, to nouriſh him at Court, is to nouriſh a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and Count <hi>Philippes</hi> is very blind, if he do not ſee that he will be his Ruine, and let his Pretences be never ſo ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he only watches an Opportunity.</p>
               <p>He is a Man who knows very well that he ſhall never go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern Madam, both becauſe of Count <hi>Philippes</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He knows alſo, that he will diſpoſe of the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> as he pleaſes, and it is eaſie to ſee the Conſequence.</p>
               <p>If Count <hi>Philippes</hi> will conſider thoſe things, the way to remove this Man will be eaſie.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, It is not the buſineſs of a Religious Man to meddle with Affairs of State; if Madam Command him to follow his Vocation, ſhe will be commended by every body.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Madam may ſend him into <hi>France;</hi> where, if ſhe pleaſes, he may be detain'd with Gentleneſs, and, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his Superiours, may be interdicted from returning into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> but when Madam pleaſes.</p>
               <p>As this Affair is important, Monſieur <hi>d' Hemery</hi> muſt have a care not to Hazard it, but he muſt ſo order it, that Madam, or Count <hi>Philippes</hi> may endeavour to bring about this Deſign ſo neceſſary to their Preſervation.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> may take two other Reſolutions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide coming to <hi>Turin</hi> to Madam's Court:</p>
               <p>The one is, to go into ſome place in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> who may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen him the Gates: and if that ſhould happen, nothing muſt be omitted to drive him out immediately, by one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in this weak Condition of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other is, to ſtay in the State of <hi>Milan</hi> nigh <hi>Piedmont;</hi> in which caſe he declares himſelf an Enemy of Madam, and her Children. In this caſe, you cannot do better, than to do as you write to ſend to offer him his Goods if he will live at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to deny them if he continue with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> you muſt by conſequence forbid all the Cities from receiving him, and in effect, you muſt take ſuch care, and place ſuch faithful Men in them, that he may be deny'd entrance.</p>
               <p>If after all, Mareſchal <hi>Crequi</hi> could, under his Noſe, give a Defeat to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> it would be very well. You muſt have a firm Foot, and a good Eye upon thoſe Occaſions, both Reſolution and Courage. We think we ought to Advertiſe you, that tho' Count St. <hi>Morice</hi> be a very brave Gentleman, yet he is altogether joyn'd to Father <hi>Monod,</hi> of which you ſhall ſeem to have no notice from us. I do not at all doubt
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42519:151"/>
but being ſeparated from this good Director, he will be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Man for Madam.</p>
               <p>In this Exigency of the Affairs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the only way to hinder the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mantua</hi> from loſing her Son's States, is ſo abſolutely to ſecure <hi>Cazal,</hi> that there be nothing to be feared on that ſide: In order to that, <hi>I</hi> think, you muſt take all thoſe who are ſuſpected, not only out of the Cittadel, but the City, and all Perſons who may be contrary to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, allied to the Little Prince.</p>
               <p>You muſt make known the King's good Intentions to the Sieurs <hi>Guiſcardi, Mercurin, Prat,</hi> and all others, who ſhall be capable, to whom the King permits you to give Penſions, as you ſhall ſee convenient, which ſhall be paid here upon ſight.</p>
               <p>As this Affair muſt be done with Magnanimity, ſo it muſt be manag'd with Prudence, giving to the Princeſs the leaſt occaſion of Complaint that can be; but it is better that by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us occaſion, as ſhe doth, by declaring herſelf for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt, ſhe may have ſome unreaſonable occaſion, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſatisfie her Deſires at the Expence of her Son, and <hi>France</hi> together.</p>

               <p>I Cannot ſufficiently commend the Goodneſs with which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam has diſcovered to you the Malice which a certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of whom you write, has made uſe of to her Prejudice, perſwading her, that her Creatures ought to be jealous of the King, and that <hi>I</hi> had told him ſomething of this nature, is ſo manifeſt an Impoſture, that a Man muſt be a Devil to invent it; and it is to be fear'd, that a Spirit capable of ſo diabolical an Artifice, may commit far greater Villanies. <hi>I</hi> confeſs, that ſince I have known this Diſcovery, that Madam's Generoſity has made, I am more afraid for her than I can ſpeak; but I hope, that her Intereſt, which has begun to give her a glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42519:152"/>
will wholly open her Eyes. The different Attempts that this good Man has made to perſwade Madam to be diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with <hi>France,</hi> altho' without Reaſon, upon the Account of the Solemnities which the King perform'd at the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Obſequies, who were greater than any that were ever made in <hi>France</hi> for any but Kings, ſufficiently demonſtrate his good Intentions. But altho' we diſcover an extream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in this, that which appears in his Endeavours, to make the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> return into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and to introduce the Abbot <hi>Soldati,</hi> as he has done once, and would again, is far greater, becauſe it directly tends to Madam's Ruine. We have ſeen Letters which report, that this good Apoſtle cryed down Madam's good Intentions; if it be ſo, it is eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that if her Highneſs do not take care of herſelf, and remove ſo wicked a Spirit, ſhe will find herſelf prevented, and unable to do it. I confeſs to you, that the King is in Pain, all Men in thoſe parts are concern'd in it; but above all, Madam's particular Creatures, being certain, that they are the firſt whom he will endeavour to Subdue, that he may the more eaſily Ruine Madam afterward: If Madam be not ſenſible of her own Intereſts, ſhe ought to conſider that of her Children; having before her Eyes, that, in ſuch Affairs, wicked Men have no bounds. Make her, in God's Name, ſet a Watch over her Mouth; and, after having by Reaſon inform'd her what may be uſeful, take this Court for an Example, which could never free itſelf from Trouble, and ſecure its Peace, as long it endured Factious Spirits in its Bowels.</p>
               <p>I think, that the Expedient propos'd, to ſend the Perſon in diſpute into this Court, is very good, provided you can make him conſent to it.</p>
               <p>You may let him know, that Madam's Protection depends chiefly upon the King; there is no probability that her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will make uſe of him in her Affairs; becauſe, in his laſt Journey, he left <hi>France</hi> not very well ſatisfied with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: And, for this reaſon, it is neceſſary for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, to be reconciled to his Majeſty and his chief Minſters. If he readily condeſcend to this Propoſal, you will gain Time by this Journy, and penetrate more and more into his Mind.</p>
               <p>If he refuſe this Overture, it muſt be with a worſe deſign than what can be foreſeen, and Madam will have more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to provide for herſelf another way: And, in effect, I do not ſee how ſhe can make any difficulty of it, knowing that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> reſolved, before his death, to uſe this Remedy, from which ſhe alone diverted him. If he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42519:153"/>
ſuch a miſchievous Spirit, ſhe ought to double her Fears, and imagine that he will practice ſo much the more boldly againſt her; becauſe thoſe who ought to revenge thoſe Crimes, may be thoſe who ſhall recompence them: Upon ſuch occaſions you muſt fear every thing, and imagine, that all preventing Remedies are ever gentle, in reſpect of thoſe which muſt be uſed when the Diſtemper rages: There are alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Evils in Affairs of State, which are no ſooner begun but they are incurable.</p>

                  </gap>e, and the Eſtabliſhment of her Authority and Grandeur. Her Inconſtancy, concerning the removal of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Monod,</hi> has been a manifeſt proof of it; which ſurprized me the more, becauſe ſhe knows the beſt of any, the mortal Hatred he has againſt her and her Children, and his inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Union with the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> her Enemies. His Majeſty thinks it very ſtrange, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam having declared to all his Miniſters, that ſhe did not deſire that he ſhould have any thing to do in her Affairs, yet ſhe ſtill continues to imploy him; he firmly believes, that ſhe only retains him, becauſe ſhe knows, that he is an Enemy to her and her State, that ſhe may make the whole World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that her Highneſs fears <hi>France</hi> more than her Brothers-in-law; which may produce very miſchievous Effects, Madam being not ignorant of the extraordinary Paſſion that the ſaid Father makes appear, upon all occaſions, for the Intereſt of tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Gentlemen, and the Ill-will which he has always bore
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42519:153"/>
her and hers, muſt be aſſured, if ſhe continue him in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, into which his Artifice and Malice has ſcrew'd him at her Court, having ſuch a turbulent Spirit, being an open Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice of the Cardinal, knowing the Humour of the People, and Madam's Weakneſs, the firſt Sickneſs that ſhall happen to her, without expecting the Extremity or the Event, he will ſend for the ſaid Prince Cardinal into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> from whence ſhe will not be able afterward to expel him, and the Life of her, her Children and Creatures will not be ſecure.</p>
               <p>She may very well judge, that his Majeſty is not concern'd what Miniſters ſhe imploys, provided they love her and her Children; but it concerns him very much, that ſhe do not employ thoſe who give her bad Counſel, and endeavour to perſwade her to her own Ruin, or to procure it unknown to her, becauſe, in this caſe, his Majeſty knows not how to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations afflict his Majeſty more than I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, becauſe he foreſees that ſuch Proceedings will either make him unable to protect a Perſon ſo dear to him as Madam, or will compel him, againſt his deſire, to diſcharge himſelf of her Protection, that he may not be the Promoter of an Evil which ſhe may avoid.</p>
               <p>You may believe, that his Majeſty, loving Madam as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, will not come to this extreamity; but yet he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſee, that her Highneſs will ruin herſelf, againſt all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, his Advice and Counſel, and notwithſtanding any Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance that he can give her.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty can have no confidence in Madam in her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, while ſhe ſhall have a Miniſter, who is a ſworn Enemy to <hi>France,</hi> to his Majeſty, and his particular Servants; who is the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s intimate Friend, and Ally of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who, by his means, will be inform'd of all the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and Reſolutions; it is a thing altogether unpoſſible. And I confeſs to you freely, that the open Protection that Madam gives to Father <hi>Monod,</hi> ſince the Reſolution ſhe took to remove him, afflicts the King extreamly, and makes him judge, and not without reaſon, that her Mind is not only wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, but alſo diſtruſtful of <hi>France;</hi> which they expreſly endeavour to make her, that they may more eaſily procure her and her Childrens ruine; which is, as it were, inevitable, if ſhe continue in her jealouſie and diffidence. Tho' this good Father teſtifie, that he imparts to you alone, the Reſolution that was taken to ſend him into <hi>France,</hi> yet, for all this, he is not ignorant, that it was with Madam's and Count <hi>Philippes</hi>'s
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42519:154"/>
participation; and ſo, ſeeing himſelf offended by both, he will infallibly ſeek an opportunity to revenge himſelf; which he will do the more boldly, becauſe he will believe, that he owes his Re-eſtabliſhment to his own Induſtry and Artifice, and not to Madam's Goodneſs, whom he will never forgive.</p>
               <p>As to what remains, Madam having obliged you to declare againſt him, ſhe is too juſt to deſire you, and <hi>France</hi> to have any confidence in him; he is a Serpent which ſhe cannot keep in her Boſom, without receiving ſuddenly a mortal Sting. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> knew him ſo well, that he was reſolved, as Madam declared to you, to remove him from Court.</p>
               <p>You know the Advice he gave us of the Intelligence this good Father had with Father <hi>Cauſſin,</hi> the good Deſigns of the one, which were at laſt diſcover'd, obliged the King to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him from Court. Madam may well judge what thoſe of the other oblige her to do, becauſe he has as much Wit and Malice, as Father <hi>Cauſſin</hi> has Simplicity and Ignorance.</p>
               <p>Before Madam had acquainted Father <hi>Monod,</hi> that ſhe knew his miſchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is your part faithfully to repreſent all theſe things to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, to whom you may ſhew this Letter, and to importune her, for her own Childrens ſake, to remove that Man as ſoon as ſhe can, having no time to loſe upon ſuch occaſions; her Fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I confeſs to you, I tremble for fear, for Madam, till that is done; and tell you further, that the King is mightily diſpleas'd to ſee, that Madam dallies in an Affair in which her ſafety is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; and that, if her Highneſs will help herſelf, he will double his Aſſiſtance; whereas, if ſhe has a mind to ruin her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he will be gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42519:154"/>
ſhall have the ſame Paſſion for her Intereſt, as for the King's, and ſhall rejoice if I can be ſerviceable to her.</p>
               <p>She has done me the honour to write to me two Letters, by which ſhe declares her Deſires of a General or Particular Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion. I pray you repreſent to her, That as a General Peace, or Suſpenſion, would be the Safety of Chriſtendom, ſo a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular one would be its Ruin: The Peace, which it may be ſhe ſhould have a Year ſooner than otherwiſe ſhe would, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving opportunity to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> better to manage their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs againſt us, weakning that on which alone her Protection depends, would, in the end, ruin her; whereas, by making a good War this Year on every ſide, by God's aſſiſtance, at the end of the following Campagn, we ſhall ſee the Eſtabliſhment of a General Peace. Let Madam ſecure the inward Parts of her State, and never trouble herſelf about the reſt. We ſend to her Highneſs the Sieur <hi>de Vignolles,</hi> whom ſhe deſired: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile him with Count <hi>Philippes.</hi> I have particularly charged him to make uſe of him in Madam's Service, as he will do faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>You judge very well, that the King can never think of an Accommodation with the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy,</hi> if he think of re-entring into the Protection of <hi>France;</hi> which his Majeſty will certainly keep for Cardinal <hi>Anthony.</hi> It is very probable, that whatſoever Accommodation the ſaid Cardinal will make, it is only to deceive better, and that it will be by the conſent of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Yet his Majeſty would run that hazard, if the Matter in diſpute were to reſtore him the Penſion of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> and the Abby of St. <hi>John</hi> of the Vineyards, provided that he depart from the Protection of <hi>France,</hi> and oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to live at <hi>Rome.</hi> But methinks, that this ſeeming that he makes, is only to amuze Madam, and when he ſhall conclude ſuch a Treaty, it will only be to impoſe upon her.</p>
               <p>I forgot to write to you one of the principal things to which you muſt preſently apply yourſelf; which is, to ſend the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which you and Mareſchal <hi>Crequi</hi> ſhall make of that which ought to be done, to carry on the offenſive War the next Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagn, it being a certain thing, that there muſt be a War. You muſt inform us How, in what Place, and what Troops you muſt have, and what Recruits, what we muſt give for this purpoſe, at what Time we muſt ſend them, and the Fund that you will need for that Affair. I pray you ſend me a very large State of theſe things, that we may immediately apply ourſelves to provide what is neceſſary. As it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that nothing be omitted in this State which is uſeful, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42519:155"/>
you to let nothing be ſuperfluous, that the difficulty of ſupplying you with thoſe things which may be let alone, may not hinder us from ſatisfying you with Neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>I do not recommend to you, to keep your Deſigns of War very ſecret, till Madam has taken care of the Affair of Father <hi>Monod,</hi> becauſe he would inform the Enemies of them, ſince alſo I preſuppoſe that Affair to be done; for otherwiſe the King will be rather obliged to recal his Troops out of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> than to ſend others thither.</p>
               <p>Since the writing of this Letter, the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> came to ſee me, who told me, that he was charged by Madam, to ask my Opinion of Father <hi>Monod,</hi> and in what eſteem he is with the King. To which I anſwered him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to your deſires; letting him know, that his Majeſty could have no confidence in a Perſon, who ſo openly favoured thoſe who acted againſt Madam: I tell you in two words what I repreſented to him at large.</p>

               <p>THOUGH I am not ignorant that M. <hi>Bouthillier</hi> has long ſince acquainted yee with the King's diſlike of the Sieur <hi>de Lizè,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Reſident in <hi>England</hi>'s Conduct, and how his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in that Court, and his ill will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>France</hi> are prejudicial to his Majeſty's Affairs, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to thoſe of his Highneſs, I cannot however forbear wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to you, to give you notice of it; that ſo by your Prudence you may apply ſuch a Remedy to it, as you ſhall think moſt proper. In my Opinion, it would be for the ſervice of Monſieur of <hi>Savoy</hi> to recall that Perſon as ſoon as might be, unleſs his Highneſs would have his Majeſty believe that he Acts by his Orders, and that he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42519:156"/>
connives at the ill Offices done to his Majeſty, ſince his Agent has been in <hi>England.</hi> You may ſpeak of it if you pleaſe to the D. of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as of a thing which the King is ſo much the more deeply ſenſible of, becauſe there is no body who hears the ſaid <hi>Lizè</hi> talk, who does not think it ſtrange, that a Miniſter of one of the principal Allies of <hi>France,</hi> and who is engag'd with her in a War againſt her Enemies, ſhould maintain Diſcourſes ſo diſadvantagious to her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, inſtead of upholding her Intereſts, and rejoicing at her Succeſſes.</p>
               <p>Moreover I am oblig'd to let you know, that the ſaid <hi>Lizè</hi> is a Man ſo weak in his Intellectuals, and of a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo feeble, that he takes whatever is reported to him for truth without diſtinction, never examining whether there be any foundation, or only the appearance of truth in what is told him. Which is the Reaſon, that many times taking the Shadow for the ſubſtance, inſtead of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Maſter, while he thinks to advance 'em, he does a manifeſt prejudice to his Intereſts. In a word, ſeeing that his Reſidence in <hi>England</hi> cannot but prove very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the King, it muſt be our Buſineſs to perſwade Monſieur of <hi>Savoy</hi> to re-call him home, which I conjure you to make your Buſineſs with your wonted Dexterity. Which not doubting but that you will effectually labour, I ſhall urge yee no farther; having no more at this time, then only to aſſure yee, that</p>

You know how many times I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh'd you to be careful of the quickneſs of your Wit, and the nimbleneſs of your Tongue. As it was always my fear, that thoſe two Enemies were the greateſt you had, I muſt confeſs that I am more affraid of 'em now then ever, and conjure yee to be more reſerv'd for the love of your ſelf, aſſuring you, that I give ſo little heed to what the ſaid Abbot inform'd me, of your being tranſported in your paſſion to reflect upon me, that 'tis no conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my ſelf which enclines me to give you this Advice. The Juſtice that has been done you in your Buſineſs makes the King's Piety ſo clearly manifeſt, and the aſſiſtance of my Friends, that he muſt have loſt his Judgment, who thinks there can be any bad impreſſion made either of the one or the other. Never were Sentences more Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick then thoſe which his Holineſs and the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil pronounc'd upon this Difference, and he cannot be maſter of himſelf, who ſays, that they were ever chang'd. Therefore, ſeeing ſuch Diſcourſes would but do you an Injury, many others which you are ſaid to give out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times would bring a Reproach upon your Gratitude; which, in my Opinion, ought not to permit you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of Fortune, who has done for you, from your early Youth, what ſhe does not uſually do for others, till after long Time ſpent in tedious Services. Were I not really your Friend, I would not talk to you in this manner: But being deſirous to continue the ſame as I have always been, I find my ſelf oblig'd to what I do, becauſe that ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not knowing yee ſo well as I do, will not ſo eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe what I believe proceeds from Vanity, rather then from any other evil Cauſe. I promiſe my ſelf therefore, that your Carriage will be ſuch as your Friends ought to deſire it, and as I particularly wiſh it may be;</p>

For this Reaſon it is, that well knowing that the Converſion and Amendment of Souls, the Prayers and Tears of good People, are the true Means that can procure us what the Impiety and Hardneſs of our Hearts have hitherto denied us, 'tis my Deſire that all the Biſhops of my Kingdom cauſe ſuch publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Prayers as they deem convenient, to be duly ſaid, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the joint Performance of all thoſe good Works that are moſt probable to obtain from Heavenly Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Repoſe of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> Now in regard there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Knowing therefore that there are ſome ſo ſedulous in their Charges, that if they abſent themſelves from 'em, 'tis only for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, and for the Diſpatch of Affairs that concern their Functions, 'tis ſufficient for me to exhort 'em to make the ſooneſt End they can of their Buſineſs, and to repair home again; expreſly enjoining and commanding all thoſe who have not hitherto minded ſo much the Importance of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding within their Dioceſſes, to haſten thither within Eight Days after the Receipt of theſe Preſents, to the end they may thereby make Amends for their paſt Defaults. I aſſure my ſelf, that they will be ſo much the more religiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant of their Submiſſion to my Will and Pleaſure in this Particular, becauſe there is not one among 'em who can be ignorant that the Canons of the Church, and the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kingdom, oblige 'em to an Actual Reſidence; upon which the good Order and Diſcipline of their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes chiefly depend.

I ſhall only take the liberty to aſſure your Ladiſhip, that M. <hi>de Seneterre,</hi> and the young Gentlemen his Sons, were ſo helpful to him upon this occaſion, which beſides the Paſſion, that in ſo doing, they teſtify'd for his perſon,

Your Majeſty has prov'd ſucceſsful in ſo many great Actions, that 'tis no wonder if now and then you meet with ſome Mortification This is farther to be ſaid, That ſince it has pleaſed the Divine Goodneſs to eſtabliſh you King over a Nation that runs to the End of the World in ſearch of Dangers, and has much a-do to ſtay for the Opportunity of meeting with 'em, you ought not to think it ſtrange that Your Majeſty, far ſurpaſſing in the good Qualities which Nature has beſtow'd upon your Subjects, ſhould be altogether exempt from their Defaults. I am over-joy'd to hear that Your Majeſty reſigns your ſelf up to the Will of God; and for the Honour you are pleas'd to do me, by declaring how much you confide in my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Counſels. I know not which way to anſwer this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, but by aſſuring Your Majeſty, that I willingly ſacrifice my Life to God, that ſo he may be pleaſed to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Counſels as profitable to your Service, as it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to deſire 'em, who reſolves to be ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>LETTER LXXI. <hi>To the</hi> KING.</head>
               <p>I Am over-joy'd for Your Majeſty's good Health; but extreamly troubl'd there has been ſo much Want of good Management in the Execution of Your Majeſty's ſo often re-iterated Orders.</p>
               <p>Your Majeſty is too gracious, and too juſt, to make me reſponſible for the Faults of others; and too greatly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd, not to conſider, that in great Affairs, the Effects never anſwer exactly to all the Orders that are iſſued forth. This is only in the Power of God to bring to paſs; whoſe Goodneſs is ſuch, that leaving Men to act according to their Infirmities, he ſuffers the Difference between their Performances, and his Will.</p>
               <p>Your Majeſty knows that I have always complain'd of the Delays of the Treaſurers and Providers of the Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; and that I have openly ſpoke it in your Councils, that it was in vain to raiſe Armies, if Care were not taken to pay 'em in time, and that they were not as carefully furniſh'd with Proviſion. And though in theſe ſort of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, I ſuppoſe my ſelf to have done my Duty, when I have admoniſh'd, ſollicited, and importun'd thoſe who are intruſted with making thoſe Proviſions, I dare preſume to ſay, that I have done more; it being certain, that if I had not taken upon me to ſend <hi>M, de Huſſay</hi> into <hi>Champaigne</hi> to buy Corn, and borrow'd Six Score Thouſand Crowns for Raiſing of Men, Your Majeſty had been diſappointed of your Preparations for your juſt and great Deſigns. I will not fail to ſollicite <hi>M. de Bullion</hi> again, to ſend Money to Your Majeſty. But becauſe that which paſſes by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Officers of the <hi>Finance</hi> cannot be done without great Delays, I have juſt now ſent away Six Thouſand Piſtoles by the Poſt, being the Remainder of what I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd. To which I muſt add, that the Honours, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, the Benefits which Your Majeſty has conferr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and the Opinion you have of my Fidelity, give me Credit ſufficient for another Twenty Thouſand Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoles, if Your Majeſty commands me in four Lines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Hand.</p>
               <p>I conclude with my Prayers to God, that all the reſt of Your Majeſty's Servants may equal me in Diligence; and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42519:181"/>
that he will be pleas'd to aſſwage your Diſquiets, which I believe no leſs neceſſary, as well for the Preſervation of your Health, as for the Good of your Affairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Beſides this, he affirms, and has ſent you a convincing Proof of it, that he has provided for the Funds that are requiſite for all your Troops.

all the Paſſes, through which Proviſions could come to us; and at length declar'd, that he would not ſtand to what he had promis'd by the Treaty of <hi>Suza;</hi> which was, to join with <hi>France</hi> to procure the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> the peaceable Enjoyment of his Territories, and pacifie the Troubles of <hi>Italy,</hi> if the King would not aſſure him to lay down Arms, till after the Conqueſt of <hi>Milanois</hi> and <hi>Genoua.</hi> By this 'tis eaſie to judge, whether the ſaid Duke's Deſigns could be conformable to His Majeſty's, who had not been perſuaded to this War, but only to ſuccour his Confederates, and ſettle the Repoſe of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> Theſe new Propoſitions of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the King's Army ſuffer'd in <hi>Cazeletta,</hi> where he ſeem'd to have lodg'd us on purpoſe, caus'd us to quit that place, and march to <hi>Rivola,</hi> where we arriv'd the 18th of this Month.

The next Day I ſent to him the Sieur <hi>Servien,</hi> to let him underſtand the ſame Reaſons; and to give the Nuncio <hi>Pancirollo</hi> an Account of 'em: But the Duke would neither ſee the ſaid Sieur <hi>Servien,</hi> nor permit him to ſpeak with the Nuncio; nor with Signior <hi>Sorenze,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador; who were both at that time in <hi>Turin.</hi> The ſame day I diſpatch'd away the Sieur <hi>de L'Iſles,</hi> that, at leaſt, he might pay his Reſpect to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> and <hi>Madam,</hi> the Princeſs of <hi>Piemont;</hi> and declare to them, how great a Grief it would be to me, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhould give the King any Cauſe, by his ill Conduct, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of him, and to ſeek Aſſurances otherwhere then in his Promiſes: Put the Gates of <hi>Turin</hi> being ſhut againſt that Gentleman, he return'd without being able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Meſſage. Upon which, the Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> and other Principal Officers of the Army, prudently judg'd, that he was reſolv'd no longer to hearken to any thing on the King's Behalf; that he was extreamly averſe from the King's Intentions; and that he rather choſe to have a War in his own Country, then to quit his Deſign of engaging the King in a continual War againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Genoneſes;</hi> and caus'd em, together with my ſelf, to conclude upon this Extremity; That we were to make uſe of that Force which His Majeſty had put into
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42519:185"/>
our Hands, to do what was moſt advantageous for the Good of his Service. We all agreed to march to <hi>Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol,</hi> becauſe it afforded us a more eaſie Paſſage of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from <hi>France,</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> deny'd us. We arriv'd there the 21th of this Month; and this Day the Town ſurrender'd, with great probability that the Cittadel will do the like in few Days. <hi>Perouſa,</hi> and the Fort adjoining to it, which His Highneſs built about a Year ago, to give a Jealouſie to the Inhabitants of <hi>Pragelas,</hi> who adhere to the King, made no Reſiſtance againſt our Men: So that from this place where we now are, there is a free Paſſage into <hi>France.</hi> I cannot expreſs the People's Joy, in the midſt of the Calamities of the War, to find that the King is now their Sovereign; ſuch is their Veneration for his Juſtice and Clemency. You may be pleas'd to acquaint His Holineſs of this Succeſs, and to let him know the Reaſons of our Proceedings; which I make no queſtion but he will approve, and judge 'em to be of great Importance and Benefit, to put a ſtop, in ſome meaſure, to the Oppreſſions and Violences that afflict, or threaten to afflict all <hi>Italy;</hi> to which all the Remedies apply'd by the Care and Admonitions of His Holineſs have been hitherto fruitleſs. If he will be pleas'd to favour His Majeſty's good Intentions, there is great Reaſon to hope that he may obtain thoſe Ends which he has always propos'd to himſelf, for the common Good. My Aſſurance that you will leave nothing omitted that depends upon your Prudence and Care to perſuade him to, obliges me to ſay no more, but that I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>A Memoir ſent to M.</hi> de Berhune, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the taking of the Cittadel of</hi> Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol.</head>
               <p>MOnſieur <hi>Bethune</hi> will ſee by the Anſwers of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs <hi>Spinola</hi> and <hi>Colalto</hi> to the Propoſals contain'd in the Rough Draught of the Peace, which <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Cardinal has ſent to M. <hi>Pancirollo,</hi> how unreaſonable the ſaid Anſwer is, and the little Likelihood that we can be ſatisfied with it, in order to the procuring a ſolid Peace;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42519:186"/>
to the end that after he has conſider'd it, he may take his time to inform the Pope of it.</p>
               <p>Which done, he ſhall beſeech His Holineſs to let the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador know his Sentiments upon it; which, according to Equity, cannot be otherwiſe then conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to His Majeſty's; to the end that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being out of hopes of concealing any longer their Artifices from His Holineſs, may be conſtrain'd to agree in things that are juſt; and which may as well for the preſent, as for the future, remove all Occaſions of any farther Troubles.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Sieur <hi>de Bethune</hi> ſhall repreſent to His Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, That one of the principal Reaſons why the King ſent his Forces into <hi>Italy,</hi> having been the often re-iterated Inſtances of His Holineſs, it would be an extream Grief to him, ſhould His Holineſs teſtifie any Coldneſs to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a Deſign, to which he was induc'd with ſo much the more Zeal, becauſe His Holineſs approv'd the Juſtice of it; and rightly apprehended how much the Succeſs of it would conduce to the Liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> to eſtabliſh the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Holy See, and to the Security of the Pope's Perſon; which were the moſt forcible Arguments that could move His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>That although His Holineſs is deſirous to preſerve the Name and Effect of Common Father, that ought not to hinder him, but oblige him rather, to make uſe of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to chaſtiſe thoſe who trouble the Family; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce 'em to their Duty, inſtead of aſſiſting 'em in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their wicked Intentions.</p>
               <p>And this was apparently done by His Holineſs's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the State of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where they reliev'd the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> with Corn; when all <hi>Italy</hi> knows, that without that Relief, they could not have ſubſiſted; though they made uſe of it, only to commit, with more Leiſure and Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, the greateſt Prophanations of holy Things, and the moſt horrid Cruelties upon all ſorts of Perſons, that are not to be imagin'd.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the ſaid Corn was ſet at ſo high a Rate, that we have Reaſon to think it was done on purpoſe to ſcare the <hi>Venetians</hi> from buying it; which the <hi>Germans</hi> were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do, conſidering the Extremity they were in, and not wanting Money, after they had plunder'd the State of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and all the neighbouring Princes; for which they may thank the Pope's Officers.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>de Bethune</hi> is alſo to complain of His Holineſs's granting Paſſage ſeveral times to the Troops, in their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42519:186"/>
March from <hi>Naples</hi> into <hi>Milanols;</hi> and ſo deſire him to let the <hi>French</hi> have the ſame Privilege, when they ſhall have an Occaſion to march through his Fortreſſes, to aid the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſaid Sieur <hi>de Bethune</hi> ſhall tell him, The King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe (though he be well aſſur'd of it) that His Holineſs, or his Nephew, the Legate, have within this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while been very importunate with the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to agree theſe Differences, without giving any notice of it to the King: As alſo, to beg the Emperor's Pardon; which would ſuppoſe, that he and his Confederates had been too blame in upholding a Cauſe ſo juſt, and of which His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs all along declar'd his Approbation.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>de Bethune</hi> muſt have receiv'd a Letter which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal wrote him about Fifteen Days ago, wherein he ſends him word, that the King would be extreamly pleas'd, if His Holineſs would but lay his Commands upon <hi>Bagni</hi> to reſide in his Army in <hi>Italy,</hi> that ſo he might be a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of His Majeſty's good Intentions, and his juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding upon this Occaſion: And that he would do well to be very importunate with His Holineſs, in the very Terms of the Letter. But if the Letter be not come to his hands, and he finds the Pope is not inclin'd to what is deſir'd, M. <hi>de Bethune</hi> ſhall renew his Inſtances in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and uſe ſuch Arguments as he ſhall think moſt proper to perſuade His Holineſs to condeſcend to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Deſire; conſidering that he knows the Prudence, the Probity, and Affection of the ſaid Cardinal to His Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the common Good. Nevertheleſs, avoiding to give the Pope any Occaſion to believe that this proceeds from any Diſtruſt of thoſe whom he employs; or that the King ſeeks after a Peace, but only becauſe the ſaid Cardinal <hi>Bagni,</hi> having been a long time vers'd in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, can be no Prejudice to His Holineſs's Deſign for the publick Repoſe; more eſpecially, ſeeing the Deceaſe of Don <hi>Carlo,</hi> his Brother, may render the Preſence of the ſaid Cardinal moſt uſeful in thoſe Quarters.</p>

               <p>THey who are remote, frequently apprehending things to be otherwiſe then they are, I thought it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to let yee know, that the Queen-Mother has declar'd, ſhe will no longer make uſe of my Service, nor of thoſe that have any Kindneſs for me, who had the Honour to be near her Perſon. And though, after a diligent Search within my ſelf for the Cauſe of this Misfortune, I find no other then my own hard Fate; well knowing that the Pleaſure of Princes ought to be as abſolute as their Power, I neither can nor ought to do any thing more, then only religiouſly obey Her Majeſty's Will. It is impoſſible for me to expreſs my extream Grief for this unhappy Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which, however, ſhall not hinder me from ſeeking all Opportunities to ſerve the Queen, to whom I am moſt ſtrictly bound for the paſt Teſtimonies of her good Will which ſhe was pleas'd to beſtow upon me; which were ſuch, that this laſt Act of hers is not capable to make me loſe the Remembrance of 'em. After ſo great a Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I thought there was nothing more for me to do, but to retire home; but it was not the King's Pleaſure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me: 'Twas his Deſire that I ſhould be near his Perſon, and ſtill continue the Management of his Affairs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he vouchſafes to honour me. not only with his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but with a good Will ſo ſingular, that he can make no Addition to it. I am, in hopes to render my ſelf ſo worthy of it by my Actions, that if hither to His Majeſty has ſhewn himſelf ſo well ſatisfy'd with 'em, they will yet more confirm him in his good Opinion. As for your parts, I beſeech yee to believe, that it will be a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to me, to let you ſee upon all Occaſions, that I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Never mind this Diſcourſe, nor talk no more of it to him, unleſs he ſpeaks of it himſelf: and if he does, you ſhall tell him, that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors being ſent to hear what would be propounded to them, and not to talk of Things for which they have no Commiſſion, you can make no other Uſe of hearing what he has to ſay, then to inform the King: Which done, you ſhall return him an Anſwer according to the Commands which you ſhall receive from the King; but you ſhall not be oblig'd to ſend back any thing, but what has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Probability and Foundation in it.

Nevertheleſs, I can tell yee, they began to ſing Triumph before the Victory, there being a Rumour ſpread about in <hi>Paris,</hi> as you wrote me word, of my Recovery, before it was really ſo effectual as I had reaſon to deſire it. You will underſtand by M. <hi>de Chauvigny</hi> the Series of my Diſtemper; ſo that I have no more to ſay at preſent, but that the laſt Apoſteme, which roſe after the two preceding days, broke of it ſelf this Night, when the Phyſicians and Chirurgeons were at a loſs in what part it was proper to launce it. Which makes me attribute this voluntary Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature to the only Goodneſs of God, through which I hope a perfect Cure. I promiſe my ſelf, this News will be as much to your Content, as you were griev'd at the Growth of my Diſtemper, knowing how great a Sharer you are in my Concerns. I am glad to underſtand by your Letter, after what manner Madam <hi>d'Angouleſme</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into the Place where ſhe is, which makes me hope ſhe will continue there. For my part, in whatever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I am, I ſhall ever be what I have always been.</p>

               <p>THE King having granted the Queen an Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fifty Thouſand Livres, towards her Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping, I deſire Monſieur <hi>Bullion,</hi> by this little Note, as having already ſpoke to him by Word of Mouth, that Her Majeſty may enjoy the Favour which the King has been pleas'd to vouchſafe her. There is ſo much Reaſon ſhe ſhould be ſatisfy'd in this Particular, ſo neceſſary for the Subſiſtence of her Houſhold, that I doubt not but Monſieur <hi>Bullion</hi> will be ready to content her. I beg of him to do it as much as in him lies, as well for the

               <p>I ſend away this Bearer, to let you know that the King has already had two little Fits of a Tertian Ague, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which held him above three Hours, having had the full Time of their Intermiſſion. Be pleas'd to give <hi>Monſieur</hi> notice of it, that he may ſend to know how His Majeſty does: In the mean time, let him not be troubl'd, for there is nothing of Danger. I will acquaint yee from time to time of the Courſe of this Indiſpoſition, which, in my Opinion, will end in five Fits of a Tertian Ague. His Majeſty fore-ſeeing that <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s good Nature may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to make more haſte then is needful, has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to write to yee, that you will do him the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to divert him from a precipitate Journey; as well for that it would cauſe too loud an Alarm, as alſo for that, as you know well, they who are ſick have no need of putting Conſtraints upon themſelves. But the King's Civility is ſuch, that though his Diſtemper ſhould require him to take ſome Medicament, of which the Operation is as neceſſary, as the expreſſing it undecent; yet he would refrain it out of that Reſpect which his own Inclination, as you know, prompts him to, even to thoſe that little deſerve it. You are ſo well acquainted with the King's Humour, that I need not tell you what a Trouble it is to him when he is conſtrain'd to do otherwiſe then he deſires. And therefore you cannot but judge it convenient, that what I write you by his Command, ſhould have the deſir'd Effect. Be pleas'd however, to aſſure <hi>Monſieur</hi> of my Paſſion to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, and of my humble Service. And for your own part, believe that I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>THE Affection which I bear you, cauſes me to ſend away this Courier, purpoſely to let you know, that if you find that <hi>Monſieur</hi> is got beyond <hi>Nantes,</hi> into a place where he may be too ſtrong for you to fetch him thence, I adviſe yee by no means to go thither, but only to ſend him word, that you are coming to wait upon him, to let him know, that his Journey is the Occaſion of too much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and that it would be more conducible to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to remove all Grounds of Suſpicion. I thought it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo my Duty to tell yee, that there are five or ſix Men of War in the Port of <hi>Breſt,</hi> which ſhall do whatever you command 'em, to hinder, if it be poſſible, any ſingle Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel from carrying away <hi>Monſieur,</hi> contrary to his Intereſt. And if they are ſail'd out of the Haven, their <hi>Rendevouz</hi> is in the Iſland of <hi>Bas,</hi> to the end you may make uſe of 'em in caſe of Neceſſity. I ſend you this Advice by the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of honeſt <hi>Huron:</hi> But in my Opinion, if <hi>Monſieur</hi> has been pleas'd to act moſt prejudicial to his Perſon, which I perfectly honour, theſe Remedies will be but <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>HAving ſeen by a Letter from M. <hi>Bouthillier,</hi> your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the King has declar'd to him that I went about to hinder his going to the Army; I beſeech yee to make known to His Majeſty, that I am ſo far from that, that I deſir'd you to haſten away, on purpoſe to perſuade him to the contrary. You are a faithful Teſtimony, that the firſt time you came to <hi>Monceaux,</hi> your Journey tended to quite another End. All the Letters which I wrote ſince, manifeſt the ſame Truth. Your Journey now is to no other end, then to ſhew the Neceſſity of his going. You know very well, that I have not been the Cauſe of his being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded. The King reſolv'd upon it himſelf, during your firſt Journey. Since, M. <hi>de Vaubecourt</hi> ſent word to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that he ought not to go; and M. <hi>Bouthillier</hi> ſent me Letters ſubſcrib'd, to the end I ſhould take the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of 'em. Upon that, I never minded ſending word that they ſhould proceed any farther, for fear it ſhould be thought I had not that Conſideration which I ought to have of His Majeſty's Safety, which is a hunder'd times dearer to me then my own Life. Not that I ever thought him to be in the leaſt Danger: But in ſuch a thing as that, 'tis for the King to take his own Reſolutions. I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that my Heart is ſometimes pierc'd with Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations in reference to the King, whoſe Safety and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity are continually in my Thoughts; yet not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a particular Care to conform my ſelf to his Humours. You may ſhew that Letter of the King's, if you pleaſe, and the Memoir which I drew up the Night before I receiv'd the Diſpatch from <hi>Monſieur,</hi> your Father. His Majeſty is too good, I am certain, not to comply with my Sentiments which he ſhall deem juſt. You know that ſuch Occaſions as theſe ruin my Health; more then all the Toil of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And if God would have vouchſaf'd to have heard my humble Prayers, the laſt of my Days had preceded that of her Removal; nor can I ſind any Comfort in the Exceſs of my Affliction, to ſee the Queen, whom I have always ſo faithfully ſerv'd and and honour'd, in a Condition of any Diſcontent. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain wicked Spirits have been ſo long a time contriving to trouble the King's Affairs, that there was a Neceſſity of applying ſome Remedy to it. During the War in <hi>Baly,</hi> they omitted nothing that lay in their power, to hinder his good Succeſs. Since that, they have ſtill continu'd the ſame Practiſes; and, in truth, Licentiouſneſs was grown to that Exceſs, that the like was never ſeen. <hi>Monſicur</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving withdrawn himſelf from the Court at ſuch a time, the King ſeveral times beſought the Queen, his Mother, that ſhe would be pleas'd, with open'd Eyes, to view theſe Miſchiefs, and concurr with him in the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Means to put a Stop to 'em. But ſhe would not be pleas'd to hearken to his Counſels, as ſhe was wont to do;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42519:199"/>
but obſtinately perſiſted in refuſing to have any Share therein; ſaying, ſhe would not have her Name made uſe of in the Reſolutions they went about to take. The King therefore finding her ſo fix'd to her own Reſolves, without being able to diſſuade her from 'em, judg'd, that if ſhe was unwilling her Preſence ſhould be uſeful to him at Court, it could not but be to his prejudice for her to be there, ſeeing that her appearing to be there in Diſcontent, would but embolden and give liberty to others to come and declare themſelves ſuch as ſhe was. I am ſo extreamly afflicted at theſe things, conſidering my preſent and eternal Paſſion for the Queen's Service, and what I owe her in all manner of Reſpects, that I can admit of no Comfort, though the Reſolution taken upon this Occaſion, was merely the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Neceſſity, not of Choice.

I believe, you are not ignorant that the Emoluments of your Employment, if you go to the Rigour of it, are not above Eighteen Thouſand Livers, ſo that the Surpluſage which you conceal, and which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to Forty Thouſand Livers, is an Extraordinary which you receive over and above; ſo that if His Majeſty ſhould allow yee another, ſuch a one as you deſire, it would be like the taking of double Griſt out of the ſame Sack.</p>

I am conſident you will judge, that the King being abſolutely unwilling to part with that Government, they have obtain'd as much as they could deſire in the World.

               <p>I Was very glad to underſtand by your Letter, how much the Gentlemen of <hi>Niſmes</hi> were devoted to the King's Service.

He aſſures himſelf of a punctual Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what they have promis'd: And I engage you my Honour, that their Privileges ſhall be carefully preſerv'd 'em; and that if there be any who have any Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Gariſon, they have no Grounds for it; giving you my Faith, and my Word, that it was a thing never ſo much as thought of, nor likely to be thought of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

begin the War again by a new Rupture, but that their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould ſerve you for a Pretence of not accepting the Peace, if you have not done it already; and for continuing the Proſecution of the War, till you have farther Orders from him. I cannot forbear acquainting you, that I am almoſt out of my Wits, to ſee that M. <hi>de Leon</hi> and Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhould ſo ſtrangely over-ſee themſelves. But I will write to you more at large within four Days: In the mean time, aſſure your ſelf, that I am cordially, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

I hope <hi>France</hi> will receive no harm on that ſide. As to what concerns M. <hi>de Lorraine,</hi> I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that he bethinks himſelf of complying with the King's Deſires; ſo that he will follow the Counſels and Practice of his Predeceſſors: The King has a Kindneſs for him; and ſo has the Queen, his Mother. <hi>Monſieur</hi> alſo, as you ſend us word, would be glad to ſhew him Marks of his Affection. For my part, I ſhall contribute all that lies in my power to the good Correſpondence which it behoves him to hold with Their Majeſties. I have always had an Honour and Eſteem for him. But this is not the firſt time that I have experimented, to my Coſt, that Pretences are always taken to complain of thoſe who ſerve the King in that Station wherein I am. No Man knows better then your ſelf, whether M. <hi>de Lorraine</hi> have any hard Meaſure, ſeeing it is under your Conduct that every thing has been

done, and is done at preſent. The Keeper of the Seals knows better then any body, what Injuſtice has been done him in the Council, ſince every thing is done before him, by the particular Knowledge he has of his Affairs.</p>
               <p>As for the ill Offices which are done me at <hi>Paris,</hi> in his behalf, according to what you ſend me word, I look upon 'em, as I do on ſeveral others of the like nature, as aſſured Marks of my Fidelity, and of my Zeal for the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. I beſeech yee, however, to put a ſtop to 'em, as much as in you lies, according as you meet with convenient Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. M. <hi>de Bouthillier</hi> has already return'd you an Anſwer in the King's Name, in reference to the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>German</hi> Lord, which you wrote about; which is the Reaſon that I ſay nothing more of it particularly.</p>
               <p>I return no Anſwer to what you ſend me word, That many who are about <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s Perſon will not ſee the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their Opinions; That I have no Deſire that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Champagne</hi> ſhould be paid, becauſe that if they who are ſo poſſeſs'd would but open their Eyes, they might up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better Grounds affirm, that I was the Cauſe that the <hi>West-India</hi> Fleet is not yet arrived in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While I was in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> I believe I wrote a hundred times at leaſt, how neceſſary it was to keep an Army on foot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Frontiers of <hi>Spain;</hi> and evidently made it out, that 'twas impoſſible to keep it under a good Diſcipline without Money. After my Return, I declar'd by Word of Mouth what I had ſet forth in Writing before. I am my ſelf at a loſs, as well you know, for want of the Payment of ſome Aſſignations that were allow'd me, towards the Re-imburſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeveral Summs which my Friends had paid before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, to the end your Army might be ſupply'd.</p>
               <p>After this, I have nothing more to anſwer, ſeeing the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects themſelves ſpeak for me. But I could wiſh, that they who have the greateſt Deſire to find Faults where there are none, would tell me, out of their Univerſal Knowledge, (for they pretend to have an Inſight into all things,) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any Kingdom in the World, which is able re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly to pay two or three Armies at the ſame time. I would have 'em tell me, whether Reaſon does not require, that we ought to be more careful of paying an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which acts in a Foreign Country, againſt a potent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and where Scarcity, and other Inconveniencies are not to be expreſs'd, then an Army that lies ſtill in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to prevent Miſchief.

It would ſhew a great peice of Levity, and make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to themſelves whom we are deſirous to favour in ſending him, that we are as little capable of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy as we are eſteemed Vain and Fickle by all the World.

I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I do not believe, 'twas either for yours or our benefit to change in ſuch a manner from White to Black, it being certain, that whatever favour you might obtain by his being recall'd, it could never be ſo much to your Advantage, as the Diſcovery which people would thereby make, that it being in your power to remove him, you muſt have alſo the ſame ſhare in his being ſent (which it behoves yee always to deny) would be to your prejudice. 'Tis your Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to govern your ſelf in ſuch a manner, that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Barberini</hi> may not think, that you have ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken any thing contrary to his Deſires.

               <p>Had the Pope thunder'd out his Excommunications againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that are in Arms within his Territories, as he has done againſt the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſuch a time, he had taken from us, in the judgment of men who are not partial to either ſide, all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of complaint, but to pour the Extremity of his Rigour upon Monſieur of <hi>Parma,</hi> and to ſay nothing to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to ſpeak freely and ingeniouſly, is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to invade his Country, and give the World an occaſion to believe, that his Holineſs is agreed with 'em, to ſhare the Spoils of that poor Prince, which will render the Interceſſion of a Legate altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſpected, at the Treaty of Peace, to all thoſe who are not favourers of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> This affair ſo nearly concerns his Majeſty, that if the Pope does not take ſuch Reſolutions as may hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from ruining that Prince, under pretence of his Allowance, many will believe that <hi>France,</hi> having no more to hope from his Holineſs, has as little to fear on that ſide. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire yee to take ſome pains in this Affair, as being of great importance to his Holineſſes Reputation, and all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and the advancement of the Peace. I muſt confeſs, that only the <hi>Italians,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Giulii,</hi> know how to do buſineſs as they ſhould do. In time of Peace they ſcatter about their ſweet Powders, and throw about their Thunders in time of War.

               <p>The one is, That His Holineſs, after he had been ſick, was no ſooner recover'd, but he decreed an Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the ſaid Duke.</p>
               <p>The Second is, That the ſaid Duke has receiv'd a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch from the King, which gives him three ſorts of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which are very harſh and ruinous.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:42519:226"/>

               <p>And, That he ſhould not be afraid of laying down his Arms, which he holds to be the Ruin of his Territories.</p>
               <p>I told him, that the King had advis'd him, plainly and uprightly to humble himſelf to His Holineſs: That he had alſo ſent him word, that the Agreement being made, he was not to make any Scruple, either of going to <hi>Rome,</hi> or of laying down Arms before the Pope, when His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſhould have engag'd his Word to His Majeſty, and other Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> for the Performance of his Promiſe.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Count told me, that the Diſpatch ſpeaks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of theſe Circumſtances, which render the King's Counſels very reaſonable; but only that it ſpeaks cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorily.</p>
               <p>However, I know that the Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſaid Duke's Affairs are in a bad Condition, as far as I can underſtand by the Count; and I ſee he is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afraid of being ſtrip'd of his Territories.

               <p>For my own part, I ſee, to my Sorrow, the Spiritual Power of the Church employ'd, to render the Temporal Power of the Popes more potent, and more effectual to decide certain Differences to their Advantage; which are much more prejudicia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, in regard that the Security of Kingdoms does not permit, that upon ſuch Occaſions any Reſpect ſhould be ſhewn to the Quality of Perſons, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for thoſe who were in the Province to do other wiſe then they did, without particular Orders. At this time therefore Prudence will not allow his Releaſment, but under ſuch infallible Aſſurances, that he ſhall not act either directly or indirectly againſt <hi>France,</hi> as are no way to be evaded. He is, and ſhall be, treated with all the Reſpect that is due to a Perſon of his Quality, and who is in that Station that he is: And I ſhall deem it a great Honour to ſee him in a better Condition, that I might be able to manifeſt to Your Majeſty, by my Reſpect to his Perſon, the Reverence I ſhall always have for Your Name, as being, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>LETTER CXCIV. <hi>To the Duke of</hi> Neubourg.</head>
               <p>IF I thought you were capable of believing what you write to me, I would make it my Buſineſs to convince yee of that Opinion; nor would my Trouble be very great. But I take you for too penetrating a Prince, to believe that <hi>France</hi> is the Cauſe of all the Miſeries which you foreſee will be fall <hi>Italy;</hi> or that I have refus'd any juſt Conditions of an Accommodation. <hi>Monſiour</hi> the Legate knows, that I made the Way as eaſie to it, as it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to do. But to conſent to ſuch a Peace, as had only the Name of a Peace, and which in three Months, would inforce us to buckle on our Arms again, I muſt confeſs, I am not capable of being perſuaded to it. I have a greater Longing for a ſound Peace in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> the Repoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Satisfaction of the Holy See, then they who moſt pretend to deſire 'em. I ſerve a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, whoſe Aim it is, not to enlarge his Dominions with the Spoils of his Neighbours; and who never diſplay'd his Banners in Foreign Countries, but to deliver from Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſuch Princes and States as are unjuſtly aſſail'd. So ſoon as they ſhall really, and not in Words alone, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe from doing Miſchief on that ſide, they ſhall find the King inclin'd to whatever can be expected from a moſt juſt Prince; and though of a Warlike Diſpoſition, yet moſt deſirous of Peace.</p>
               <p>As to the Miſeries wherewith you threaten <hi>France,</hi> His Majeſty's Arms are ſo long, that though he has one ſtretch'd out into <hi>Italy,</hi> he will with the other ſufficiently defend his remoteſt Frontiers; and if they think to force him to a Defenſive War on that ſide, they will force him to act contrary to what he deſigns, and to what he thinks of leaſt of all.

               <p>In the mean time, I muſt tell yee, that they who blame Artifice and Wily Craft upon ſuch Occaſions as theſe, have great Reaſon for what they ſay, ſince nothing has hinder'd the paſt Treaties about the Affairs now in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, but thoſe Tricks and Shifts which have been put in practiſe, contrary to our Deſire and Expectation. 'Tis eaſie to know the Deſigns of thoſe, who have always talk'd as loudly, as they have acted openly on this ſide; but impoſſible to make 'em talk things that are not in their power. The Prudence of thoſe who have meddl'd in this Affair, is too much eſteem'd for having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to delay the Preparations which they are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to make for the War.

Peace is ſincerely deſir'd; but a ſafe and honourable Peace. And when we ſhall ſee in reality the Securities which your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence has propos'd, the Declaration of the Treaty of <hi>Monſon,</hi> which you ſpeak of; and the effectual Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Breaches of the ſaid Treaty, as your Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting declares that the Marquis <hi>Spinola</hi> is willing to do, then we ſhall believe thoſe Gentlemen have ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Peace; and it will be clearly ſeen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have Reaſon to ſay that <hi>France</hi> has no mind to it. You ſay, that, on our part, we want Effects; and that, on your part, you propound nothing but your

Thoughts, upon which, you know, there is no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be laid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mon Seignicur</hi> the Cardinal has always talk'd diſtinctly, according to the Power wherewith he is intruſted, in an Affair, upon which he could not as yet have time to know the King's Pleaſure. He has no other End, no other Aim, then the Welfare and Repoſe of <hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> And when he underſtands His Majeſty's Intentions, he will ſpeak 'em as freely as he has hitherto done his own particular Sentiments. I pray to God, to bring all things to a good Concluſion; which, I know, we both of us ought, and do deſire.</p>

                  <hi>The Inſtructions of M.</hi> Schomberg, <hi>Count of</hi> Nantueil, <hi>Counſellor to the King in his Council of State, His Majeſty's Lieutenant-General in</hi> Limouſin, <hi>the</hi> Upper <hi>and</hi> Lower Marche, <hi>for his Journey into</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, 1617. <hi>Sign'd</hi> de Richlieu, <hi>out of M.</hi> de Puys<hi>'s Study,</hi> MS. 121.</head>
               <p>THE firſt thing that M. the Count of <hi>Schomberg</hi> is to have before his Eyes, is, that the End of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>Germany</hi> is, to diſſipate the Factions that may be ſet up there, to the prejudice of <hi>France;</hi> to carry the King's Name as high as poſſibly may be, and powerfully to ſettle his Authority there.</p>
               <p>This being the End propos'd, he is next to ſee what are the moſt ſpeedy and proper Means to attain this End.</p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>Examen,</hi> the Means will be found proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Ends, in divers Kinds; ſome General, others Particular. General; thoſe that may be ſerviceable over all <hi>Germany.</hi> Particular, are ſuch as muſt be vary'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Diſpoſitions of ſeveral Princes. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ones alſo are to be of a various Nature; either ſuch as are proper to deface the ill Impreſſions that have been made in thoſe Parts, by miſrepreſenting the Affairs of <hi>France;</hi> or proper to ſettle an honourable and advantageous Belief; or ſuch as are capable to produce both theſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects together.</p>
               <p>The firſt conſiſt in refuting and eradicating the Opinion inculca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by thoſe of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince's Party, that he was ſeiz'd without any lawful Cauſe.</p>
               <p>They conſiſt alſo in making it out to be a perfect Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, which has no other Foundation then the Paſſion and Impoſture of our Enemies, to ſay that we are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Romans,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Spaniards;</hi> that we embrace the Intereſts, either of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> to the prejudice of our ancient Alliances, to the prejudice of our ſelves; that is to ſay, of thoſe who profeſs the pretended Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42519:234"/>
in <hi>France,</hi> or of thoſe that hate <hi>Spain,</hi> and pride themſelves in calling themſelves true <hi>French</hi>-Men.</p>
               <p>The Second General Means conſiſts in making a good Impreſſion of our Government, in juſtifying our Actions, though we are not oblig'd to give 'em an Account of 'em. And this may be eaſily done, by taking Cognizance of all that has been done in <hi>France</hi> ſince the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, of glorious Memory, according to the Diſcourſe hereafter ſet down.</p>
               <p>The Third General Means conſiſts in Viſits, Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Civilities, Aſſurances, and Teſtimonies of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; which are generally very proper to extinguiſh Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, to remove Ill Will, and create Kindneſs at the ſame time. And as to this Point, there needs no other Inſtruction, then what Natural Civility, Dexterity and Wit inſpires into thoſe that are to make uſe of their Parts.</p>
               <p>Only, you muſt obſerve, That for avoiding all manner of Jealouſie, there needs no other Order in the Viſits that are to be made to Princes, and Imperial Cities, then what your Journey ſhall preſcribe: And that one of the moſt important things to perſuade 'em, is, that we put a high Value upon their Alliance; and that we have an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Care to preſerve 'em; and that upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they ſhall receive our Aſſiſtance. This is that which will ſlide into their Minds, greatly to our Benefit, if dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly inſinuated into the Compliments that ſhall be made 'em; if, in order to make 'em believe what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe 'em for the future, you artificially lay before 'em what we have formerly done for 'em; and how that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> II. carried his Arms into <hi>Germany,</hi> in Defence of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces proſecuted to the utmoſt Extremity. How that <hi>Henry</hi> the Great always protected and favour'd em, was ſtrictly united with 'em by the Treaty of <hi>Hall;</hi> and a little before his Death, ſet a powerful Army on foot upon the Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of ſome of the Princes.</p>
               <p>As to the Particular Means, they are various, according to the various Intereſts of Princes, who have any thing of Quarrel with us. The Memoirs preſented by their Agents, will inform yee of their Pretenſions; and our Anſwers annex'd to 'em, will let yee know how far we can now go, in order to treat 'em civilly upon their Demands.</p>
               <p>After the execrable Parricide committed upon <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, of immortal Memory, upon the 14th of <hi>May,</hi> 1610. the Queen, being declar'd Regent by the King, her Son,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42519:235"/>
ſitting in Parliament, upon his Seat of Juſtice; and being as ſoon acknowledg'd by the common Conſent of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Lords, the Sovereign Courts of the Kingdom, and, in a Word, by all <hi>France;</hi> the firſt thing ſhe ſet before her Eyes, was, the maintaining of Peace, and keeping the King's Subjects fix'd to his Perſon, by the Ties of Favours and Benefits.</p>
               <p>To attain this End, ſhe renew'd the Edict of <hi>Nantes;</hi> and by that means removes all manner of Jealouſie out of the Minds of her Subjects: She re-calls <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and retrieves him out of the Arms of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> into which he had thrown himſelf; enlarges his Penſions upon his Arrival, makes him great Preſents, and heaps her Favours upon him; opens her Hand of Bounty to all the reſt of the Princes and Lords, and engages 'em by great Sums of Money.</p>
               <p>Conſidering that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>trength of a Prince lies as much in his Counſel, as in his Arms, and being deſirous, in all things, as much as poſſibly might be, to follow, the Steps of the deceaſed King, his Lord and Father; ſhe makes uſe of thoſe whom ſhe finds to have been employ'd by him in the Management of Affairs.</p>
               <p>Things being thus ſettl'd, as ſhe thought to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd the Repoſe which <hi>France</hi> enjoy'd; a Repoſe ſo entire, that we may truly ſay, ſhe had no other Trouble, but that of her Sorrow, and her Tears; her next Buſineſs was, to take care of Foreign Affairs.</p>
               <p>The Death of the Duke of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Juliers</hi> being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a great Diſpute about the Succeſſion, the Competitors had Recourſe to Arms; upon which, ſhe takes the ſame Reſolution which the deceaſed King had taken, to interpoſe her Authority: She ſends Forces thither, to render the Reaſons for her compoſing that Difference more prevalent and powerful.</p>
               <p>Having accompliſh'd her Deſign, to the great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Crown, ſhe preſerves the glorious Title which that great Monarch had acquir'd, of Arbitratrix of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Foreign Tempeſt was no ſooner calm'd, but a Storm threatens <hi>France:</hi> However, ſhe immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd fair Weather, by diſſipating the evil Deſigns of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral factious Spirits, who, to take the Advantage of our Misfortunes, would fain, in the Aſſembly of <hi>Saumur,</hi> have engag'd the Kingdom in a War.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:42519:235"/>
               <p>Having warded off this Blow, ſhe maintains all things in Peace, till the Troubles began at <hi>Mavieres,</hi> in the fourth Year of her Regency; Troubles which ſhe ſtifl'd in the Birth, by the Treaty of <hi>Monehould.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Following her Inclination, which perſuaded her to Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, ſhe pardons all the King, her Son's Enemies; and deſpoils him of ſome of his Towns, to deliver 'em into their Hands; opens his Treaſure, imitating in ſo doing, that ſame ancient Prince, who thought it behoov'd him to give away for the Good of the People, what had been hoarded up to that End. She endeavours to hold faſt thoſe turbulent Spirits with Chains of Gold. But her Hands were no ſooner empty'd of the Treaſure which ſhe had given away, to purchaſe Peace, but the Clouds began to thicken again, preſaging a new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>torm. And now, the Tempeſt pouring down, ſhe is not daunted; but becauſe ſhe did not think fitting to avoid the Tempeſt by giving way to the Waves, ſhe reſolves to reſiſt the Weather, and make head againſt the Whirl-wind: And indeed, her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution was attended with ſuch good Succeſs, that march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt her Enemies, ſhe reduc'd 'em by Force, to what ſhe could not bring 'em by Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poictou</hi> and <hi>Bretagne</hi> being ſwept clean, ſhe returns in Glory, with her Son, to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Peace of <hi>France</hi> being more firmly ſettl'd by this Progreſs, a War broke out in <hi>Italy:</hi> Thither ſhe ſends, to quench it; and ſhe prov'd ſo ſucceſsful, that ſhe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd what ſhe undertook.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time ſhe declares her Son to be of Age, cauſes the Edicts of Pacification to be re-publiſh'd; and having a little before ſummon'd together the States of the Kingdom, to regulate the Diſorders of the Realm, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the Oppreſſions of the Subjects, ſhe moſt induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly labours to render the Fruit of that Aſſembly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to her Deſigns; and being diſturb'd in her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, by Branglings, Factions, and a Thouſand Artifices, ſhe diſappointed 'em all as much as poſſibly ſhe could.</p>
               <p>That Aſſembly applauded and thank'd His Majeſty, for that, after he came of Age, he had unloaded the Burthen of his Affairs upon her Vigilancy. Preſently, to preſerve the King's Dignity, ſhe re-demands the City and Caſtle of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> which had been granted to <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince, and has 'em ſurrender'd.

               <p>Nevertheleſs, he attains his Ends, his Marriage is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd.

                  <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince being arriv'd, ſhe ſhares with him that Authority which ſhe exercis'd with the Permiſſion of the King, her Son: Nay, ſhe does more; ſhe deſpoils her ſelf of it altogether, to inveſt him in it; abſenting her ſelf from the Councils, and leaving to him the entire Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Finances: a thing as extraordinary, as unheard of. But this Obligation was no ſooner laid upon <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince, but it was forgotten.</p>
               <p>Hardly was a Month expir'd, before it was perceiv'd that he was poſſeſs'd by thoſe Evil Spirits, who always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated him to the Ruin of <hi>France:</hi> 'Twas perceiv'd that he render'd Evil for Good, deſiring the Government, and ſowing a Thouſand Reports among the People, to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of the Queen. He goes farther; He throws himſelf into the firſt Factions, cabals all the Societies, and endeavours to make ſure to himſelf all the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe Ends, ſeveral Aſſemblies were held in the Night-time; Darkneſs being proper to cover the Shame which Conſpiracies imprint in the Foreheads of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers: The Curates and Preachers were tamper'd with, and Publick Faith was violated. <hi>Peronne</hi> was taken by the Arms of the Sieur <hi>de Longueville,</hi> but by the Counſels of <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince, and his Adherents.</p>
               <p>This open'd the Eyes of all the World; the Apoſteme breaks, and the Matter appears; ſeveral diſcharge their Conſciences, accuſe themſelves, and teſtifie their Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; one Prince depoſes, a Princeſs talks; two Dukes intervene; a Prelate declares what he knows; ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what came to their Knowledge, and all unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree to reveal a pernicious Plot againſt the King, his Kingdom, and his Government: 'Tis confirm'd that they aſſure themſelves of Soldiers. Laſtly, <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince ſpeaks, believing his Plot diſcover'd; he confeſſes it to the Queen, palliating his Offence as much as he can; tells her, that the King and ſhe are beholding to him for their Lives; and promiſes never to procure any Meetings, and to deſiſt from his factious Beginnings.</p>
               <p>The Queen pardons him, reſolves to forget all that is paſt; but underſtanding by undeniable Proofs, that the Prince's Acknowledgments were all counterfeited, that he had new Meetings, that he was reſolv'd, as before, to make himſelf Maſter of the King, her Son's Perſon, and hers, Nature could not permit her to ſuffer more: She ſhew'd her ſelf to be a Mother, ſhe ſhew'd her ſelf to be a Queen, by ſecuring thoſe that ſought her Ruin.</p>

               <p>For this Reaſon ſhe arreſted <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince; and without doing any Injury to his Perſon, procures the Good of the whole Kingdom, by that Means diſappointing his pernicious Deſigns.</p>

The Queen, without loſing her Courage, advis'd the King to put himſelf into a Condition to reduce 'em by Force, then to ſtretch forth his Arms of Mercy, and admit 'em to acknowledge their Faults; or that, if innocent, they might juſtifie themſelves; if guilty, that they might have Recourſe to his Compaſſion. To this Effect the King goes to his Parliament, and gives 'em an Account of all that had paſs'd, and imparts to all the World, what he need not have done, the Reaſons which forc'd him to that Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, promiſes a ſtrict Performance of the Treaty of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Several Perſons interpoſe, complain of theſe Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, find fault with the Arreſt; though commended by all good Men, approv'd by Foreigners, as alſo by <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Prince, though the Perſon moſt intereſted; who, touch'd in Conſcience, confeſſes ingenuouſly, that by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his Perſon, they ſecur'd the Perſon of the King.</p>
               <p>They are offer'd all the Security they could deſire; they accept of it; the King forgets their withdrawing themſelves, and all that was paſt; Their Majeſties receive 'em into their Favour, as if they had never given any Cauſe of Offence.</p>
               <p>All things being now quiet, People were aſtoniſh'd that M. <hi>de Nevers,</hi> who was never known to have tamper'd with theſe Factions, diſpleas'd at ſomething that had happen'd between the Governor and him, gives himſelf the Liberty to ſpeak diſreſpectfully of the Queen, and to the diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>People wonder'd that he ſhould permit himſelf to run out into Actions which exceeded the Bounds which no true Subject can tranſgreſs in a Sovereign State, or ought to exceed in reference to his Prince: He provides Arms, liſts Soldiers, takes the Field with ſome, re-inforces his Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and fortifies his Towns.</p>
               <p>Intelligence comes from all Parts, that they gave out ſalfe Reports among the People.</p>

               <p>Upon this, our Eyes are open'd again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, by the Advioe of all his Council, to ſend Forces to the Places where thoſe Diſorders were committed, not ſo much to do any Harm to any Body, as to prevent Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs. He ſends Commiſſioners into his Mutinous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, to inform themſelves of ſuch as deviated from their Duties; and after an exact Cognizance thereof, to apply requiſite Remedies.</p>
               <p>This is an exact Recital, and, as it were, a Picture, in ſhort, of the Government of this Kingdom, for theſe ſix Years.</p>
               <p>They who have nothing before their Eyes, that may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from diſcerning Things, ſuch as they are; nor a Will that carries 'em contrary to their Knowledge, find very little to urge againſt all this, but only to what the Misfortune of Times, cuſtomary to the Weakneſs of Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties introduces, for which there is no Remedy to be apply'd.</p>
               <p>But ſome diſaffected Perſons, like thoſe envenom'd Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs that convert into Poiſon the beſt of Nouriſhments, obſerve in the Government many Things, which being rightly conſider'd, deſerve rather to be applauded, then ſound fault with.</p>
               <p>The firſt Action which they cenſure, is, the Marriage with <hi>Spain;</hi> which they put in the firſt place, as a <hi>Hidra,</hi> with ſeveral Heads; ſince, as they reckon, from thence proceeds the Diviſion of <hi>France,</hi> the Rupture of ancient Amities, and the Scorn of Foreign Alliances with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second is, the Waſte of the Treaſury.</p>
               <p>The Third is, the Fortune of ſome Foreigners.</p>

               <p>By theſe Heads, artificially diſguiz'd, and publiſh'd, they decry the Government which, however, being du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider'd, will appear as worthy, as they would render it infamous, after we have cut off all the Heads of this monſtrous <hi>Hydra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make 'em approve the Alliance between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> I ſhall not inſiſt much upon it, that 'tis an ordinary thing for thoſe two Kingdoms to unite themſelves by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; Hiſtory containing a great Number of Examples: Of the moſt remarkable were, the Marriage of <hi>Charlemaine</hi> with <hi>Galiena,</hi> the Daughter of the King of <hi>Toledo;</hi> Of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Bald</hi> with <hi>Iſabel,</hi> the Daughter of the King of <hi>Arragon.</hi> Of <hi>Francis</hi> I. with <hi>Elenor,</hi> Siſter to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. Of <hi>Charles</hi> IX. with <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Daughter of the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and Grand-daughter to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not urge, that becauſe the Enmities between great Perſonages are frequently pacify'd by Marriages, that therefore this Match was uſeful to eſtabliſh a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns. I will not inſiſt, that there was nothing remaining for this Monarchy to do, being aſſur'd of all her Neighbours, but to ſecure her ſelf by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with this Crown; to the end, that being in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from without, ſhe might be the more at liberty to reduce thoſe that endeavour'd to trouble the Kingdom within.</p>
               <p>I will not ſet forth, that we have already gain'd this Advantage by Marriages; that they have, at leaſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd thoſe who have gone about to trouble the Repoſe of <hi>France,</hi> the way to make a Benefit of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was formerly wont to foment our Diviſions, and ſow 'em alſo among us.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſufficient to ſtop the Mouths of thoſe that condemn 'em, to juſtifie 'em, and cauſe 'em to be approv'd by all the World, to declare, that they were deſign'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd by the deceaſed King; that they were agreed to by the Princes, Lords, and Officers of the Crown; tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Duke of <hi>Maine;</hi> commended and deſir'd by the Three Orders of the Kingdom; imparted to the King of <hi>England,</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Bouillon;</hi> and to other Princes, Republicks, and Confederates of this Crown, by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors reſiding near their Perſons; and laſtly, happily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd: And that, inſtead of a bloody War, of which, as it was given out, they were to be the Fore-runners, they have been attended with a general Peace over all <hi>France;</hi> which Their Majeſties being deſirous always to preſerve among their People, as they have ſufficiently made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, there is no Occaſion to fear, that, contrary to their Words, and the Edicts of the deceaſed <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, they will attempt any thing that may infringe it.</p>
               <p>'Tis to no purpoſe to urge the daring Humour of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> ſeeing that, without diving into their Intentions

and Deſigns, we ſhould do our ſelves an Injury to believe that we cannot keep our own, and preſerve our ſelves from thoſe who juſtly ought to fear us.</p>
               <p>Then again, 'tis an idle Terrour, to fear that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance of the two Crowns ſhould occaſion the Diviſion of <hi>France.</hi> For no Man will readily believe, that a Man will burn his own Houſe, to do his Neighbour a Kindneſs: Or that a Man will hate and ruin himſelf, for the Love of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Different Beliefs do not render us different Kingdoms: We are all united under one, in whoſe Service no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is ſo blind, as to think a <hi>Spaniard</hi> better then a <hi>French Huguenot.</hi> There will be found a real Diviſion, not in this World, but in the other; not occaſion'd by the Matches between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> but by the Diverſity of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions. If this Match contain'd any Article contrary to the Edicts of Pacification, there might be ſome Reaſon to fear: But there being no ſuch thing, quite the contrary; ſeeing the Articles are ſign'd and decreed; ſince it is done, and conſummated; ſeeing the Edicts have been renew'd no leſs then four times, upon the Death of the late King, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King's Majority, at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and at <hi>Laudun,</hi> though thoſe of the Religion had greatly offende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the King, in joining with the Rebels, what Reaſon is there to fear that he will give any Interruption to what the deceaſed King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great has eſtabliſh'd, for the Union and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of his Subjects? What Reaſon have they of the pretended Reformed Religion to complain, ſeeing their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts have been renew'd under this Reign, and confirm'd ſeveral times; their Penſions augmented and paid, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Exigencies of State: Themſelves alſo aſſiſted againſt the moſt zealous and furious Catholicks, as the Difference between the <hi>Rochellers</hi> and M. <hi>d' Eſpernon</hi> can juſtifie; and laſtly, favour'd to that degree, that we may ſay, that many Enterprizes have been unpuniſh'd for their ſakes.</p>
               <p>You muſt not forget to inſinuate. how that we ſent back the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that waited upon the Queen, which clearly juſtifies our Deſign to make our ſelves <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, You muſt take an Occaſion to ſignifie to 'em, to our Advantage, that we deſire not the Advancement of <hi>Spain:</hi> We offer 'em, tho' diſcreetly, to aſſiſt 'em againſt the Attempts of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſet the Crowns of <hi>Hungary, Bohemia,</hi> the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Empire, upon the Head of a Child of <hi>Spain:</hi> And to give 'em Proofs of our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42519:239"/>
and to let 'em ſee that we have no Deſigns, but the Good of the Empire, 'twere well that you ſhould let 'em know, that we pretend to no other thing, but only to concurr with 'em to ſet the ſaid Crowns upon the Head of that Perſon whom they ſhall deem moſt acceptable to His Imperial Majeſty, and moſt uſeful to <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then this Match can create no Jealouſie by any Condition inſerted in thoſe Articles, 'tis paſt all Doubt, that if they have any Cauſe to except againſt it, 'tis by reaſon that the Alliance with <hi>Spain</hi> is of it ſelf odious, and prejudicial to <hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> In which Caſe, <hi>England</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves more juſtly to be blam'd then we, ſince ſhe has ſo paſſionately ſought the ſame Alliance that we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. This Match ought alſo to give as little Jealouſie to the Foreign <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as to the <hi>French;</hi> ſince the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of State, that bind Princes, are different from the Intereſts of the Salvation of Souls; which obliging us to live and die in the Church wherein we were born, bind us only in reſpect of others, to deſire 'em by fair Means, not to hall 'em by Force and Conſtraint.</p>
               <p>Several Chriſtians have been ſo united with Miſ-believers, that their Arms have never been ſeparated in Conqueſts of this World; though in thoſe which they pretend to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they have been divided.</p>
               <p>Since Errour inſinuated it ſelf into <hi>Europe,</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and among our ſelves, theſe Crowns have been united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ſame Bonds. <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> having married <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> II. theſe two Kings being greatly puiſſant; <hi>Henry</hi> naturally Warlike, and an Enemy to the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> the Crown of <hi>England</hi> enjoy'd by a Woman, the <hi>Catholicks</hi> potent in her Country; <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was Leagu'd to <hi>France,</hi> by the Marriage of <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> to <hi>Mary Steuart.</hi> The <hi>Huguenots</hi> were every where weak; they had not any Province in <hi>Flanders,</hi> not one in <hi>France,</hi> Liberty of Conſcience was forbid; nevertheleſs, theſe two Crowns were ſo far from making any Advantage of their Union, againſt the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and other neighbouring Countries, that on the other ſide, the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> in <hi>France</hi> rebell'd againſt their King; in <hi>Flanders,</hi> againſt their Prince; and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt their Queen.</p>
               <p>All that we deſire, is, to preſerve our ſelves in ſuch a manner, that they may make no Attempts upon us. In that Caſe, we ſhall ſhew, that no People ſurpaſs us in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to maintain our ancient Alliances, for which we have a high Value.</p>

               <p>Does not our deſire to renew our Union with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> appear by the Tye which binds us to <hi>Spain?</hi> It appears by the Conditions which we have coveted to that end, that we wholly deſire that Alliance; and by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who have relax'd in their purſuit of it, in proſecution of new Alliances with <hi>Spain,</hi> that there is Cunning, if not Malice, in what they do, to render us odious, in order to make themſelves acceptable.</p>

If afterwards they ſlip in ſome obſcure <hi>Article</hi> into their Treaties, to the end that by putting their own Interpretation upon them, they may take from thence a plauſible Pretence to diſclaim em when they pleaſe, as it has fallen out in that particular, where lies the Fault? The <hi>Spaniard</hi> obliges himſelf to remove from the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> the Jealouſie of his <hi>Arms;</hi> the Duke interprets this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to be an abſolute laying down of <hi>Arms:</hi> The <hi>Spaniard</hi> averrs, That his meaning was never to oblige himſelf to ſtand to that Condition; are we to be reſponſible for theſe Shifts and Artifices? Is it not ſufficient that His Majeſty interpoſes afreſh, to reconcile this Diſpute? Does he not ſatisfie by ſo doing, what he may be thought to owe the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> out of Civility, by permitting his Subjects freely to aſſiſt him? That his whole <hi>Army</hi> conſiſts of Twenty thouſand men; Is this a feeble Succour to a Prince? What have we done, that it might not be thought we have broken the Laws of our alliance with that Prince? We permitted a paſſage to the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;</hi> but how? With ſuch aſſurance, that he ſhould have no Benefit by the Permiſſion; when the Embaſſadors of <hi>Savoy</hi> agreed to it, judging before us, that in ſo doing we ſhould oblige <hi>Spain</hi> without opening her Purſe, ſince his Maſter could receive no Prejudice.</p>
               <p>People are too apt to obſerve what with moſt probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be ſaid againſt us, but not what really juſtifies us. They raiſe Cauſes of Complaint, but paſs over in ſilence that for which they ought in Juſtice to thank us.</p>

               <p>Is it a Contempt of our ancient Alliances with <hi>Spain,</hi> to grant the <hi>Venetians</hi> a paſſage through the <hi>Griſons,</hi> which they cannot have without us, and without which the Arch-Duke <hi>de Grets</hi> would have had great Advantages over 'em?</p>

If it be a Contempt to ſuffer Prejudice, that we may do another a Kindneſs, we deſpiſe our Alliances; and which is more, we are reſolv'd to deſpiſe 'em in that manner, to the end that by that Contempt we may give 'em all the Cauſe imaginable, not of Complaint, but of Content and Satisfaction.

               <p>The good Husbandry of the deceaſed King's Treaſury left us, when he was taken from us, Five millions in the <hi>Baſteille;</hi> and in the hands of the Treaſurer of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi> between ſeven and eight millions more, which he had appointed for the payment of the Army, which he had rais'd with an intention to have enlarg'd the Bounds of his Fame, which could admit of no other than the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>But the Uncertainty wherein that fatal Accident plung'd us, requiring that we ſhould ſecure our affairs by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe of a conſiderable ſtrength, we were conſtrain'd to employ one part of thoſe Finances toward the maintaining for ſome months a great number of Soldiers that had been raiſed before: ſo that the ſaid Expence, the King's Funeral Charges, and the Coronation of the Queen, in a ſhort time, very much leſſened the reſerve.</p>
               <p>After the death of that great Prince, who was the true Pattern of Government, it was impoſſible to prevent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders from growing to ſuch a head, while ſeveral meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Merits by their Ambition, were not aſham'd to demand and importunately to ſollicit where they durſt not ſo much as wiſh for during the King's Life. But they made their Advantage of the Neceſſity of the Times; they offer'd their Service, they boaſt their Abilities to ſerve, or otherwiſe to do miſchief, and at length clearly ſhow, that they will not be brought to their Duties, but upon advantageous Conditions, behaving themſelves in ſuch a manner, that they themſelves, who had aſſiſted the King in hoarding up his mony, adviſe the Queen to comply with the Times, by opening her hands, and giving largely to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body.</p>
               <p>In purſuance of this Counſel, ſhe augments the Penſions and Maintenances of the <hi>Princes, Lords,</hi> and old <hi>Servants;</hi> ſhe gives 'em new ones; ſhe augments the Garriſons of their Towns, as well for the ſatisfaction of thoſe that kept 'em, as for the ſecurity of the Kingdom, and keeps in Pay
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42519:241"/>
more Soldiers than ſhe was accuſtom'd to do. The aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of theſe Penſions, one with another, amounted to three millions every year. The Roll of the Light Horſe and Regiments in Pay is now at Three millions and three hundred thouſand Livres; whereas in the year 1600 they were no more than Fifteen hundred thouſand Livres. She beſtowed a great number of Preſents, and ſo by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Counſel, without encreaſing her Receipt, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing it Two millions and Five hundred thouſand Livres upon the Salt every year, ſhe encreaſed her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences to that degree, that upon an exact examination of it, and conſidering the Condition to which we are reduced by ſo many neceſſary Expences, we are rather to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended than blamed, for being at ſo great a charge.</p>
               <p>Monſieur the Prince, in ſix years, received Three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions ſix hundred and ſixty thouſand Livres. Monſieur and Madam the Princeſs of <hi>Conti,</hi> above Fourteen hundred thouſand Livres. Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi> near Seventeen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Livres. Monſieur <hi>de Nevers</hi> Sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Livres. M. <hi>de Langueville</hi> Twelve hundred thouſand Livres. Meſſieurs <hi>de Mayenne,</hi> Father and Son, Two millions and odd thouſand Livres. M. <hi>de Vendoſm,</hi> near Six hundred thouſand Livres. M. <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> and his Children, near Seventeen hundred thouſand Livres; and <hi>M. de Bouillon,</hi> near a million of Livres.</p>
               <p>All the Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe number is encreaſed above half in half, received four times as much as they had before, their Penſions being augmented to 24000 Livres apiece; within ſix years, for every one, to 144000 Livres; and for eight, as they were always wont to be, one with another, to One million one hundred fifty two thouſand Livres.</p>
               <p>Six other Dukes or Officers of the Crown received the ſame Gratification, amounting in ſix Years to Eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty four thouſand Livres.</p>
               <p>By this it is eaſie to ſee how the Treaſure of <hi>France</hi> was exhauſted, ſeeing that eleven or twelve Articles in favour of the Grandees of the Kingdom amount to near ſeventeen millions, not including their Salaries, and the Fees belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Employments; beſides the encreaſe of Pay for their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42519:241"/>
ſelves to Arms, have put us to the Charges of Twenty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in extraordinary expences.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being conſider'd, can their Majeſties be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of waſting their Treaſure? muſt it not be clearly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, that if <hi>France</hi> be in Debt, 'tis by reaſon of the Expences ſhe has been conſtrain'd to be at for her own Children? If they who are mentioned have received ſo many Benefits, what have others done? They were not remiſs either in begging or receiving. By conſequence the publick Exigencies having conſtrained the giving not only to thoſe that ſerv'd us, but alſo to be liberal to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of thoſe that begged of 'em, as it appears by this, that the encreaſe of Penſions, concerning which we have ſpoken in general, thoſe of the Princes and Lords being deducted, amounts for the laſt ſix Years, ſince the King's death, to ſeventeen millions; thoſe of the Soldiers in pay, to above nine millions, and the Gifts beſtowed to one or other, not to ſpeak of thoſe preſented to the Grandees above mentioned, to Sums almoſt incredible.</p>
               <p>If the deceaſed King, who was at liberty to be ſparing in his expences, becauſe of his abſolute Authority, could not in ten years of uninterrupted Peace, hoard up, beſides the payment of ſome Debts, above thirteen or fourteen mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions; can it be a Wonder, that in ſix years of continual Trouble, wherein the weakneſs or misfortune of the times obliged us to have our Hands continually open, we ſhould be ſomewhat in Debt?</p>
               <p>No body ever did ſo much with ſo little in ſo much time; never did Veſſel reſiſt ſo great a Tempeſt with ſo few Wrecks as were obſerv'd in ours.</p>
               <p>After this exact account of Expences, who will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Blindneſs and Paſſion of thoſe who impute the miſeries and neceſſities of this Kingdom, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of ſome Foreigners? Who will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ſuch People blame a Government which is not to be found fault with? That they complain when there is no occaſion; that they condemn Expences, which they know in their Conſciences were made for their ſakes.</p>
               <p>'Tis no ſtrange thing, that a Foreigner ſhould make his Fortune out of his Country; that in this Kingdom ſuch perſons may be advanced to Honours and Employments, Hiſtory produces ſo many Examples of it, that inſtead of being troubled to find 'em out, a man may make his choice of ſuch as he pleaſes to make uſe of.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:42519:242"/>
               <p>That which is ſo much diſcourſed of, is far from the Degree of Preferment to which others have attain'd; he is only a Foreigner born, but ſo much a <hi>French</hi> Foreigner, that he ſhows his Fortune to none but <hi>French.</hi> How many of the beſt Families of this Kingdom have been advanced by his procurement? Where is that man whom we load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Maſter's Favours, who is not obliged to their Majeſties for 'em?</p>
               <p>In <hi>England</hi> all the <hi>Scotch</hi> are advanced, and no <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> but one Stranger only, all the reſt <hi>French,</hi> What cauſe for Complaint in this? If there be any, 'tis they that make it are to be blamed, and not they who are complained againſt. Since it may be truly ſaid, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all in three words, the Government was ſuch, that if we conſider it without Paſſion, there can be nothing found in anſwer to this Article, nor to any thing elſe here ſet down, but that there may be ſeen to have been in it too much Clemency without Rigor, too many Favours without Puniſhment.</p>

               <p>THE King ſent his Commands to the Marqueſs <hi>de Terſnel,</hi> by his Secretary, to go back to <hi>Rome</hi> (in caſe he met him in any part of <hi>Italy</hi>) to continue to ſerve his Majeſty there in the Quality of his Ambaſſadour in ordinary, judging it neceſſary in the preſent Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Affairs to give his Holineſs a conſtant and perfect Knowledge thereof. But the ſaid Secretary found him ſo forward on his way that the Marqueſs could not eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the ſaid Order, and therefore proceeded towards the Court; where at his Arrival he has confirmed his Majeſty's Reſolution about the ſending of ſome M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is indeed at <hi>Rome</hi> Cardinal <hi>Vicenzo,</hi> late Vice Protector, whoſe Fidelity and Affection the King is fully ſatisfied with, and Cardinal <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini,</hi> lately honoured with the Comprotectorſhip, who both take Care of his ſaid Majeſty's Affairs in his Ambaſſador's Abſence: But whereas there ſeems to be a certain Emulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, concerning the Mannagement and Direction of the ſaid Affairs, and that it is highly important to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the true State and Conſtitution thereof to his Holineſs, together with the Cauſes and Motives of the Counſels and Reſolutions that have been taken by his Majeſty, which can never be performed ſo well as by Perſons ſent on purpoſe, with freſh Informations of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever has been tranſacted there; his Majeſty has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the aforeſaid Conſiderations to ſend the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lyons</hi> expreſly to <hi>Rome,</hi> being perſwaded that he could chuſe no perſon more fit for the executing of that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42519:243"/>
Office, by reaſon of the Experience the late King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Memory had of him there, when he ſerved the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly See and his late Majeſty in the Quality of Auditor in the <hi>Rota,</hi> and the Reputation he has left there of his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Probity, which will give him the more Credit with his Holineſs and the ſacred College, whenever any Occaſion ſhall happen to treat with them for his Majeſty's Service.</p>
               <p>There are Two Affairs depending at this Time which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this Miniſtry; the one general relating to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tranquility of <hi>Italy,</hi> and indeed of Chriſtendom; the other particular, reſpecting the Welfare of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and both of them the Honour and Satisfaction of his Majeſty. The ſaid Archbiſhop is to begin the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of his Office, by kiſſing the Feet of his Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the King's Name, by preſenting the Letters his Majeſty has written to him with his own Hand, by aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of the Perſeverance of his Devotion and Filial Obſervance, of his Zeal and Deſire for the Increaſe and Propagation of the Holy Name of God, and of the Catholick Apoſtolick Roman Religion, according to the Example of the Kings his Predeceſſors, and of his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Care to promote and ſettle the general Repoſe of Chriſtendom, as alſo to maintain Union and Concord among all the Princes his good Friends. Allies and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to make them Sharers of that Peace with which it has pleaſed God to bleſs his Kingdom, by the Death of the Marſhal <hi>d'Ancre,</hi> who was the ſole Incendiary and real Cauſe of the Troubles that have been raiſed of late Years, and the Spring of thoſe Diviſions that have perplexed all the parts of the State, and the Minds of the Grandees thereof, making uſe of both to advance himſelf, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Credit and Authority under the King's Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Weakneſs of a Regency, and a confuſed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That having attained ſuch a degree of Power and Inſolence by means as unjuſt as baſe, and after having received more Favours and Honours than ever he could deſerve, or at firſt durſt hope for, he had reduced the Power of his Sovereign to the neceſſity of ſerving his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Paſſions, and made it the Inſtrument of his inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Avarice and unbounded Ambition; inſomuch that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had cauſed moſt of the Princes and ancient Officers of the Crown to be removed from his Majeſty's Perſon, in order to mannage and diſpoſe all things with greater Liberty, and to imbezle and order the King's Revenue at
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42519:243"/>
his Pleaſure, under Pretence of doing him Service, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the principal Affairs of State, he brought the Kingdom into Confuſion, that he might govern alone, according to his own Fancy, to the Diſgrace and Prejudice of the Dignity and Authority Royal, and took the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, at the Expence of his Majeſty's innocent afflicted Subjects, of the Calamities and Miſeries of the War, of which he was the principal Author and Contriver, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Fortune he had built upon ſuch illegal Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which his Majeſty, after having born too long, has been forced to deſtroy, in order to reſtore Peace to his People, and deliver the Kingdom from the Perſecution of a Man that was ſo Ingrateful and Wicked; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence whereof has immediately convinced every one, how pernicious and deſtructive his Life was to the State, which has recovered its Vigor and former Peace by his Death: The Princes and Lords who had taken up Arms preſently returned to their Duty, and aſſured the King of their entire Obedience, without any Conditions but their Fidelity and his Majeſty's Goodneſs: And he is ſo well ſatisfied with their Service and Aſſiſtance at preſent, that he promiſes to himſelf by their good Advice and Counſel, together with that of thoſe whom the late King had always imployed with Succeſs in his moſt important Affairs, and were removed by the Malice of that perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Man, to reign (by the Grace of the Almighty, the inſpirer of the Hearts of Kings, and their Director to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and to his Glory) in all Equity and Goodneſs over his Subjects, in Peace and Amity with his Neighbours, and in all Reverence towards the Holy See and his Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, on all occaſions.</p>
               <p>If our Holy Father enquires' Why then his Majeſty did not rather chuſe the common Methods of Juſtice in puniſhing him for his notorious Crimes, that he might ſerve as an Example to Poſterity? the ſaid Archbiſhop is to anſwer, That it was his Majeſty's Intention ſo to do, and that it was ſo ordered: But that the Perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to apprehend him perceiving that he was guarded, and preparing to defend himſelf, were obliged to have recourſe to this Extremity, for fear of miſſing an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſuch conſequence for his Majeſty's Service, who is an Enemy to Blood, and to ſuch extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, tho' juſt on ſuch occaſions. This Accident fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, the King took particular care to ſend an ample account thereof to the Queen his Mother, whoſe Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42519:244"/>
and Favours he had too much abus'd. She was ſoon ſenſible that His Majeſty had been forc'd to it, for no other conſideration, but the welfare of his Affairs, for which ſhe has always ſhew'd her ſelf very affectionate, ſince the Death of the late King her Lord, cheriſh'd and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully embrac'd every Occaſion to promote the Good, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Advantage of the State to His Majeſty's Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Glory; who was very deſirous that, according to her affection and experience in the affairs of his State, ſhe would have been pleas'd ſtill to continue that Care, and to eaſe and aſſiſt him with her aſſiduity and prudent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. But ſhe deſired to be excuſed of ſo great a Burthen, have Leave to remove from Court and the hurry of affairs, to apply her ſelf with more Freedom to the Service of God, and a quiet Life: So that the King preferring her Deſire and Satisfaction to that of her Preſence, and the advantage of her aſſiſtance, yielded, tho with great regret, to her Entreaties and reiterated Inſtances to retire, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Guards to accompany her honourably with her own, to the place which ſhe her ſelf had made choice of and deſired for her abode: and the King endeavours to alleviate the Trouble of her abſence, by frequent Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Viſits to enquire after her Health. This ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers with the like care and affection; which is a Subject of great Joy and Comfort to all thoſe who obſerve this Royal Correſpondence, and his Majeſty's Filial Reſpect, with that natural and reciprocal affection which the ſaid Queen contributes towards it. And this His Majeſty is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to continue, on all occaſions, more by real effects, than by any outward formal appearances, to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his Duty and Obligations to her for the conſtant care ſhe has had of his Royal Perſon, and for the Welfare of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>As to the preſent Difference between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> every body knows, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Holineſs, (to whom a particular account has been given from time to time of thoſe Tranſactions) the earneſt Endeavours uſed by His Majeſty at the very beginning, to prevent the misfortunes and accidents which ariſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to His Majeſty's great Sorrow, who has not only repreſented the ſame to the Emperor, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the ſaid Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and where-ever elſe it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but has alſo ſent three Embaſſies extraordinary at the Deſire and Entreaty of the ſaid King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of which produced the Treaty of <hi>Aſt,</hi> not obſerved
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42519:244"/>
ſince by the ſaid King and his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> employ'd in the Government of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> This obliged the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> again to provide for his Defence and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and his Majeſty to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enew his good Offices on both ſides, by the Sieur <hi>de Bethane,</hi> to mediate and reſume the ſaid accommodation. But the Treaty has been ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into <hi>Spain,</hi> without conſulting the Marquis <hi>de Seneſcey,</hi> his Majeſty's <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> in ordinary there, any wiſe about it; or ever acquainting his Majeſty with the Cauſe of this ſudden removal and alteration, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he had been ſo zealous in promoting it, at the earneſt Entreaty of the ſaid Catholick King without any proſpect but that of the Publick Good. However the King is not ſo much concerned at their Endeavours to deprive him of the Honour of the Agreement, after his having taken the mediation thereof upon him at their Entreaty, as he is to find that the ſaid Negotiation has not ſucceeded to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Parties; neither does he any wiſe envy any body the honour and ſatisfaction thereof; provided ſo good a Work be done, no matter by whoſe means. But he has a juſt cauſe of Diſpleaſure, and to complain, that notwithſtanding ſuch good Offices and Demonſtrations of Friendſhip made in all Candor and Sincerity for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſatisfaction, the ſaid King has all of a ſudden unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly, and without acquainting his Majeſty therewith, attack'd the ſaid Duke with open Force, even beſieging his chief Cities and Fortreſſes, contrary to his often reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Promiſes and Aſſurances, that it was his Deſire to compoſe this Difference amicably; and that he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothing to the diſadvantage of the ſaid Duke, or of his Dominions. This Proceeding has no leſs ſurprized his Majeſty than enflamed his Courage, and obliged him to take Reſolutions which he all-along endeavoured to avoid by mildneſs and treaties; his Honour and the Intereſt of <hi>France</hi> not permitting him to ſuffer the Duke of <hi>Savor</hi>'s being oppreſt, eſpecially he not refuſing to ſubmit to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Conditions when offered to him, which on his part has not been done hitherto: in which caſe he would be the firſt to blame his Highneſs, and to compel him to condeſcend by force, as he will always be againſt thoſe that ſhall moleſt him, or invade his Territories againſt Juſtice and Reaſon. This His Majeſty has declared to the ſaid King's Ambaſſador, reſiding at his Court, and has cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame to be repreſented to the King himſelf by his Miniſter in <hi>Spain;</hi> That comparing the juſt Cauſes and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42519:245"/>
reaſons thereof, with the perils and misfortunes that may ariſe, and are to be expected from the ſequel of ſuch a reſolution, he might rather chuſe a Treaty to compoſe all things amicably, than to proſecute a Deſign, attended with many Inconveniences very prejudicial to the general Peace, and to the particular <hi>Repoſe</hi> of <hi>Italy;</hi> that will be made the Theatre on which this bloody Tragedy will be acted, to the diſadvantage of the Princes and States thereof: And, beſides the ſenſible Diſpleaſure his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will receive thereby, it will be difficult to avoid its proving fatal to the Church and <hi>Carholick Religion,</hi> by the multitude of Strangers of divers <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Religions,</hi> who are preparing to run to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as to a common Cauſe, both out of Dread and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of the encreaſing Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> and for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Cauſe itſelf, as well as by the example of others. The aſſiſtance of the States of the <hi>

               <p>Moreover, his Majeſty looks upon this means as the moſt effectual to promote a good underſtanding between the Parties, and to prevent their proceeding any further. For his Arms ſhall never be imployed to diſturb the Peace of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but on the contrary to ſettle it, to oppoſe thoſe that would interrupt it, and to maintain every one in his Right; proteſting before GOD and Man, that this is his real Intention, and that he only takes Arms by force and conſtraint, and, for his Honor, to preſerve the ſaid peace, and to protect his Friends; as it appears by the good Offices and Endeavours heretofore uſed by him, and ſtill continued with Vigor in <hi>Spain</hi> and elſewhere, and will be farther evinced by real Effects in this and all other occaſions. This the Archbiſhop is to repreſent to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to Cardinal <hi>Borgheſe,</hi> to make them ſenſible of the Conſequences of ſuch a Reſolution and Breach; his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſincere Intention in this affair, the Endeavours he has uſed, and ſtill continues to prevent it, together with the powerful motives and reaſons inducing him thereunto, to the end that being mov'd by their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and uſual Prudence in affairs of ſuch weight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; either by perſons ſent on purpoſe, or by other means ſuitable to the urgency of the danger, they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevail with the ſaid King to encline to a Peace which will be more honourable, more uſeful to his affairs, and without any compariſon, far more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous for the Public Good than a War, the events of which are uncertain, long, and liable to produce Effects contrary to our expectation and projects. That in caſe the ſaid Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhould refuſe to ſubmit to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to what ſhall be thought juſt by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Friends, his Majeſty, as he has already declared, will not only be againſt him, but will joyn his Arms with the ſaid Rings, to compel the ſaid Duke to it by force, eſpouſing no Party on this occaſion but that of Juſtice.</p>

               <p>His Majeſty being of opinion, that the moſt effectual way to compaſs the end he propoſes, was to obtain a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion of Arms on both ſides, during which, means might be thought on for a reconciliation: he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the ſame to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, who anſwer'd, That he had no Power to do it; but that he would write to the King his Maſter about it, to whom his Majeſty has likewiſe made the ſame Propoſition by his Ambaſſador in ordinary reſiding at his Court: and his Holineſs would do well to ſecond the ſaid Suſpenſion, by his entreaty and recommendation, in order to its being the ſooner granted by the ſaid King, leſt matters being once exaſperated, and one ſide getting ſome conſiderable advantage over the other, this Remedy, as all others tending to a Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould prove the more difficult, and the evil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to the prejudice of all, and particularly of thoſe who deſpiſe the means of an accommodation.

               <p>The ſaid <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> is to repreſent the ſame thing to the great Duke, in his paſſage through <hi>Florence,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaluted and aſſur'd him of his Majeſty's Good will, knowing his affection for the Welfare and Friendſhip of thoſe two Crowns, as a perſon who had a great ſhare in their conjunction, in order to his uſing ſuch means as he ſhall think moſt convenient for the importance of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.

               <p>The ſaid Archbiſhop is likewiſe to communicate the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs he ſhall be intruſted with to the Cardinals <hi>Delfini, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini,</hi> and <hi>Bonzi,</hi> as much as he ſhall think neceſſary and proper; not to give them cauſe to ſuſpect, that the King doubts their devotion to his Service.

He is to take a particular care not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part them to the Abbot <hi>d'Aumale,</hi> whoſe Behaviour the King has no reaſon to be ſatisfied with: he is to obſerve it ſtrictly, and without taking the leaſt notice thereof, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Majeſty therewith.

               <p>AT the King's Return from the Progreſs he made in <hi>Guyenne</hi> about his Marriage, his Majeſty being at <hi>Tours,</hi> Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> left the Court, being diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Treatment he had received there; for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Monſieur <hi>de Bullion,</hi> and the Commandore <hi>de Sillery</hi> were baniſh'd from thence, and that the Chancellor <hi>de Sillery,</hi> and M. <hi>de Puiſieux,</hi> daily did expect the ſame fate, he thought it no longer ſafe to tarry with his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, the Conference at <hi>London</hi> was conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Satisfaction; and the old Miniſters being baniſhed from Court, and others put in their Room, the Prince returned to <hi>Paris.</hi> I do not poſitively know what paſs'd between him and the Grandees that were with the King at that time, about the Marſhal <hi>d'Ancre</hi>'s Ruine; but it is certain that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi> ſent a Gentleman to Monſieur <hi>d' Eſpernon</hi> at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to acquaint him, That the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and he were rennited, that they were in Hopes of ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> and that he deſired him to enter into the Union, which was made between moſt of the Grandees of the Kingdom.</p>

               <p>Tho' Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> was not reſolv'd to joyn with them, yet he did not abſolntely reject their Propoſition.</p>
               <p>Within ſome Days after this, being at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> he was inform'd that the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre</hi> had left this Court abruptly, and almoſt at the ſame time that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was ſecur'd.</p>
               <p>This put him upon the reſolution of going to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> and of ſending the Archbiſhop of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> his Son, to their Majeſties, to aſſure them of his Service.</p>

                  </gap>fore the ſaid Archbiſhop's departure, Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi> ſent a Gentleman to him, to give him an account of the Reaſons he had to leave the Court upon the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s impriſonment, and to deſire his advice and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, in caſe he could not agree with the King.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi>'s Anſwer was, That the ſhorteſt Follies were the beſt; and, That as he was not concern'd in what he had done, ſo he had no Counſel to give him. That for his part he was ſending one of his Children to the King and the Queen-mother, to aſſure them of his Fidelity and Service.</p>
               <p>Soon after this the Archbiſhop of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> arriving at Court, found Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi>'s Peace concluded, and ſaw him return, but in ſuch dread of being ſecur'd, that he was ready to fly again, the night the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was remov'd from the <hi>Louvre</hi> to the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> upon ſome Informations he receiv'd that the Guards were doubled.</p>
               <p>During theſe Tranſactions at Court, Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> was in his Government, when having receiv'd a Letter from the Mayor of <hi>Rochel,</hi> which he thought was not very reſpectful, he made a very rough Anſwer to it, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to go into the Country of <hi>Aunix,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of his Government.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell whether he was induc'd to this by his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and particularly to the <hi>Rochelois,</hi> who refus'd to own him as Governor of the Province; or whether he ſought a Pretence to take Arms during the Troubles which he fancied yet greater than they were at Court, and to ſeize the King's Receipts. However, upon this Pretence he gave out Commiſſions to raiſe men, aſſembled the Gentry of the Country to accompany him in his Journey to <hi>Surgeres,</hi> and took the Mony he found in the King's Coſters. I do not poſitively remember whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was before or after this Journey the ſaid Mony was ſeized.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:42519:248"/>
               <p>The Tranſactions of this Journey into <hi>Anjou</hi> gave great diſturbances to the <hi>Rochelois,</hi> who did not remember the having ſeen any Souldiers in their neighbourhood; and the fear the Court was in, loſt this might create a War with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> oblig'd their Majeſties to ſend Monſieur <hi>de Boiſiſſe</hi> to Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon,</hi> to put a ſtop to thoſe Broils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boiſiſſe</hi> being come to <hi>Surgeres,</hi> found no Difficulties in this affair, but ſuch as proceeded from the ſaid Duke's Humor; ſo that after ſome Pains and Conteſtations, he did perſwade him to obey, and to return to <hi>Xaintonge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was at that time <hi>Carbonnier</hi> brought him a Brief of Duke and Peer for Monſ. <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and moreover of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him the Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre</hi>'s Daughter for his ſaid Son, which Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> refuſed, and the ſaid Lady died ſoon after.</p>
               <p>At this very time Monſ. <hi>de Bullion</hi> came for ſhelter to Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon,</hi> not thinking himſelf ſafe in his own Houſes.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor <hi>de Sillery,</hi> and <hi>Puiſieux</hi> his Son, alſo beg'd ſhelter of him in <hi>Mets,</hi> which was granted them, but matters altering at Court, before they had executed that deſign, they alſo alter'd their minds.</p>
               <p>After his return from <hi>Aurix,</hi> and ſome ſtay at <hi>Xaintes,</hi> he went from thence to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> much about the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At the beginning of the Siege of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> Monſ. <hi>de Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> who had all-along kept a ſecret correſpondence with the Duke <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> laid the firſt Foundation of a third Party, and made a Propoſal to the Duke <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> to joyn with the Marſhal <hi>d'Eſdiguieres, Bellegrade,</hi> and other Lords, to prevent the ruin of the Princes, which ſeeur'd inevitable, under pretence of deſiring a Peace.</p>
               <p>But the Treaty went on ſo ſlowly, and the Siege of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> was proſecuted with ſo much vigor, that I am of opinion there was not time enough to bring it to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And tho the Duke <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> ſeem'd inclinable to <hi>Bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>'s Propoſitions, and was in hopes to prevail with the Marſhal <hi>de Rocquelaure,</hi> the firſt Preſident of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and and part of the Nobility, and of the Parliament of <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne;</hi> yet there was no great likelihood of bringing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to a concluſion,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bullion</hi> knows more Particulars of that affair than I do.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> was informed at that time, that ſomething was treating with the King about the Mareſchal <hi>d'Ancre,</hi> without knowing poſitively what it was.</p>
               <p>But the matter was ſoon clear'd by the news of his death, the detention of the Queen-mother in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and her Journey to <hi>Blois,</hi> whither ſhe was ſent two days after it.</p>
               <p>Hereupon Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> diſpatched <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> to the King, to congratulate his Majeſty upon what he had done againſt the Mareſchal <hi>d'Ancre;</hi> and at the ſame time charg'd the ſaid <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> to wait on the Queen-mother at <hi>Blois,</hi> and to make a Compliment to her upon her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>He alſo diſpatched Monſ. <hi>de la Valette</hi> to Court, with a reſolution to follow him, as he did within a few months; and being come to <hi>Loches,</hi> he ſent ſome Soldiers to the ſaid Sieur <hi>de la Valette,</hi> to be diſtributed in the firſt Company of the Guards.</p>
               <p>But Monſ. <hi>de Luynes</hi> having notice of it, being very ſuſpicious, as fearing the Duke's having a deſign againſt his Perſon, he repreſented it ſo hainouſly to the King, that Monſ. <hi>de la Valette</hi> was oblig'd to remove the ſaid Soldiers, and ſend them to <hi>Mets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the firſt Proof Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> had of Monſ. <hi>de Luynes</hi> ill-will towards him, and I believe it would have ſtopt his Journey to Court, had he not received this News ſo near <hi>Paris,</hi> that he could not poſſibly go back without a manifeſt Breach.</p>
               <p>Soon after his arrival at Court, he diſcover'd, on two occaſions, that Monſ. <hi>de Luyne</hi> was not pleas'd with his preſence.</p>
               <p>The firſt was, in the promotion of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> to the Cardinalſhip, who was preſer'd to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Tholouſe;</hi> notwithſtanding his Nomination was Ten years after his.</p>
               <p>The other was, in the Diſpute of the Dukes with the Lord Keeper <hi>du Vair;</hi> in which, tho the Cauſe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and that the Duke <hi>de Montmorency</hi> was Speaker, yet the fault was only laid at Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernons</hi> Door.</p>
               <p>And it is certain that the King was ſo exaſperated againſt him, that he gave him to underſtand, that his preſence at Court was diſpleaſing to him; ſo that he immediately took leave of his Majeſty, and left <hi>Paris</hi> within a few days.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:42519:249"/>
               <p>During his abode at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſeveral perſons ſpoke to him from the Queen mother, and others to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marquis <hi>de Moſni</hi> was the firſt who carried a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>Chanteloube</hi> to the ſaid Archbiſhop, and preſt him to go to him in the Country, but the Duke <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> diſapproved it, and anſwer'd, That he would anſwer to nothing till he were come to <hi>Mets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This did not hinder Madamoiſelle <hi>du Tillet</hi> from coming to him, nor from delivering a Letter to him from the Queen-mother, together with a Diamond-Watch her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſent him.</p>
               <p>She prevailed with him to read the Letter and keep the Watch, but he would engage to nothing while he was at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he went from thence he deſign'd to ſpend ſome days at <hi>Fontenay,</hi> to order his affairs: but <hi>Guron</hi> having given him notice from the Chancellor, if I am not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that he was not ſafe there, he left it immediately.</p>
               <p>Soon after his arrival at <hi>Mets,</hi> the Queen-mother ſent <hi>Vincens</hi> to him, formerly Secretary to the Mareſchal <hi>d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre,</hi> who was ordered to make his application to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> as he did.

               <p>The ſaid Archbiſhop having acquainted the Duke, that this man was come to him, and that he was commanded to ſpeak to him, he appointed to meet him the next day at the ſaid Archbiſhops houſe.</p>

               <p>Not but afterwards he was ſometimes in doubt as to the time of the execution of his Promiſe, and put off his Journey from <hi>Mets</hi> near five months together; but ſtill he perſever'd in the reſolution of doing the Queen this

               </p>
               <p>The Anſwer he made to <hi>Vincens,</hi> after ſome ſlight Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Queen-mother, was, That he would ſerve her according to his deſire; but that in order to execute that deſign, it was neceſſary for him to remove from <hi>Mets,</hi> and that he could not leave that place in ſafety, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Queen would allow him Fifty thouſand Crowns for the payment of the Garriſon.</p>
               <p>He alſo told him, that he could not hearken to that Treaty, in caſe the Sieur <hi>de Ruccellai</hi> were acquainted with it, becauſe he looked upon him as his Enemy, on the account of the Marquis <hi>de Rouillac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vincens</hi> anſwer'd to this, That <hi>Ruccellai</hi> neither had nor ſhould have the leaſt knowledge of this Treaty; that the Marquis <hi>de Moſni,</hi> and <hi>Chanteloube,</hi> were the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom the thing had been or ſhould be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; That he would acquaint the Queen with what the ſaid Duke ſaid to him; and that he believed there would be no difficulty in this point, becauſe the Queen had Two hundred thouſand Crowns at <hi>Florence,</hi> and that it would be eaſie to ſend for Fifty thouſand from thence.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>Vincens</hi> was diſmiſſed by Monſ. <hi>d' Eſpernon,</hi> and went back to the Queen-mother at <hi>Blois,</hi> where he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her Majeſty with the ſaid Duke's Reſolution to ſerve her.</p>
               <p>Her Majeſty did not detain him long, without ſending him back with great Thanks a Promiſe to perform what he deſired, and a Letter to the ſaid Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon,</hi> by which ſhe declared, that ſhe no wiſe Intended to engage him to do any thing againſt the Kings Service.</p>
               <p>She alſo ſent him one, the ſaid Duke <hi>d' Eſpernon</hi> had deſired of her for his diſcharge, which the King had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to her, by which his Majeſty gave her leave to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any part of the Kingdom, commanding all Governors to receive her.</p>
               <p>The ſaid <hi>Vincens</hi> was alſo order'd to go to <hi>Florence,</hi> for the Fifty thouſand Crowns which were to remain in <hi>Mets;</hi> and Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> was to begin his Journey on the 15th or 16th of <hi>August,</hi> 1618; but divers things ſtopt him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the month of <hi>January</hi> of the following year.</p>
               <p>During Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi>'s ſtay at <hi>Mets,</hi> and <hi>Vincens</hi> Journeys to and fro, two things came to paſs which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his ſuſpicion againſt Monſ, <hi>de Luynes,</hi> and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his Reſolution of ſerving the Queen-mother.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:42519:250"/>
               <p>The firſt was an Advice he received from one <hi>la Grange</hi> an Inhabitant of <hi>Mets,</hi> that Monſ. <hi>de Luynes</hi> had tampered with him, and ſome other Inhabitants of the ſaid City, to ſerve him againſt Monſ. <hi>d' Eſpernon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond was, that the Sieur <hi>de Peraes</hi> acquainted the Archbiſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> that applications were made to him from Monſ. <hi>de Luynes,</hi> preſſing him to approve a Viſit he deſigned to make to Monſ. <hi>de Luynes,</hi> in order to diſcover his Deſigns againſt Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſaid Archbiſhop did not oppoſe the deſire of the ſaid <hi>de Pernes,</hi> but he acquainted Monſ. <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> with it, who was his Uncle; and the ſaid <hi>de Pernes</hi> gave Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> an account of what had paſſed, and excuſed his having ſeen Monſ. <hi>de Luynes,</hi> upon the Archbiſhop of <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe</hi>'s Advice.</p>
               <p>But to perſwade him that he was no ways wanting in his Fidelity towards him, he told him ſince a thouſand ill things of Monſ. <hi>de Luynes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two Advices encreas'd Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi>'s Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions to that degree, that he thought himſelf oblig'd, for his own preſervation, abſolutely to embrace the Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers Party, and ſpeedily to execute what ſhe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to him for her liberty.</p>
               <p>During theſe Tranſactions, and <hi>Vincens</hi>'s going to and fro from <hi>Blois</hi> to Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon,</hi> he received Letters from Court, that Monſ. <hi>de Luynes</hi> had ſome deſire to be his Friend; that he was ſorry for what paſt about the Difference of the Dukes with the Lord Keeper, and for the ill Treatment he had received in particular about it; and that if he would ſend the Archbiſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſhould receive all manner of ſatisfaction there.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> received this Propoſition, not as a thing that did alter his deſign, but to make uſe of it to remove the Suſpicion the Court might have of him, and to treat with more Safety about the Queen-mothers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</p>
               <p>Being then reſolved to ſend the Archbiſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> to the Court, he gave the Queen-mother notice thereof.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Archbiſhops Journey was in the month of <hi>July</hi> 1618. He was informed at his arrival there, that Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle <hi>du Tillet</hi> was taken up, that <hi>Barbin</hi> was proſecuted, and that the Court did proceed with great ſeverity againſt all the Queen-mothers Servants.</p>
               <p>The Order he had, being at <hi>Paris,</hi> was to ſpeak to the Marquis <hi>de Moſni</hi> alone, and to tell him that Monſ. <hi>d'Eſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:42519:250"/>
was to depart from <hi>Mets</hi> on the 15th or 16th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to repair to <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> from whence he would execute the Deſign they had for the Queen mothers Liberty.</p>
               <p>But as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> was about to ſpeak to the Marquis of <hi>Moſni</hi> in the Queen's Cloſet, he found himſelf ſo furpriz'd, that he could neither hear nor anſwer him. The next day the ſaid Marquis ſent the Sieur <hi>de Ruccellai</hi> to him, to be inform'd of what he ſaid the day before. And as the Archbiſhop began to deny his being any wiſe privy to the things h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> talked of, <hi>Ruccellai</hi> told him all the Particulars of <hi>Vincens</hi> divers Journeys, and that he was the Author of the whole Treaty; beſides that, all the Queen-mother's affairs paſſed thro' his Hands.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> was very much ſurprized at the knowledge <hi>Ruccellai</hi> had of all the Tranſactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Queen-mother and Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon;</hi> but ſeeing he could not diſown it, he only advis'd him not to let the ſaid Duke know that he knew the Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother's deſign, becauſe it would hinder the execution thereof.</p>
               <p>During theſe Tranſactions <hi>Sardini</hi> and <hi>Ruccellai</hi> were commanded to leave <hi>Paris,</hi> which the firſt did with all the ſpeed imaginable, and the other refuſed to obey the King's Commands, until he had ſeen Monſieur <hi>de Luynes.</hi> But after having obtained leave from him by Colonel <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano</hi>'s means to remain ſome days longer there, he was forced to go, and retir'd to <hi>Joinville,</hi> to the Cardinal <hi>de Guiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Archbiſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi>'s Journey to <hi>Paris</hi> there only paſſed Compliments between Monſieur <hi>de Luynes</hi> and him, about Monſieur <hi>d' Eſpernon</hi>'s affairs; without coming to a more particular declaration of Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Bardin</hi> and Mademoiſelle <hi>du Tillet</hi> were try'd the ſaid Archbiſhop returned to <hi>Mets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He found that <hi>Vincens</hi> had been there during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and that the Queen mother had ſent him to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> if I am not miſtaken, about the Fifty thouſand Crowns.</p>
               <p>Soon after the ſaid Archbiſhop's arrival at <hi>Mets,</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Letters from <hi>Ruccellai,</hi> by which he defir'd to ſee him; and after ſeveral Journeys to and fro, Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon,</hi> who had hitherto ſuſpected him, offered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him ſecretly at <hi>Mets.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:42519:251"/>
               <p>The ſaid Sieur <hi>de Ruccellai</hi> immediately accepted this Propoſition; and after having been at <hi>Sedan,</hi> he came to Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> at <hi>Mets,</hi> who was ſo delighted with him, that he placed an entire confidence in him from that moment, and made uſe of him for his reconciliation with the Duke of <hi>Bouillon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſaid <hi>Ruccellai</hi> made ſeveral Journeys to <hi>Sedan,</hi> and to <hi>Joinville,</hi> where the Cardinal <hi>de Guiſe</hi> was; and after having reconciled the Dukes <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> and of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> he propoſed to them to ſend for the remainder of the Two hundred thouſand Crowns the Queen-mother had at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their deſign was to divide them between the Cardinal <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> Meſſieurs <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> and <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and to raiſe 12000 Foot and 3000 Horſe, to divert the King's Forces, in caſe the Queen-mother were attacked, after her being retir'd at <hi>Angouleſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Bouillon</hi> deſir'd, if I am not miſtaken, Twelve thouſand Crowns to ſupply the Neceſſities of his City, which were granted him, and taken out of the Fifty thouſand Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> had in his hands; as alſo Eight thouſand, that were given to <hi>St. Luc</hi> to provide Arms.</p>
               <p>During all theſe Treaties, more time was ſpent than Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> had taken for his Journey of <hi>Xain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue;</hi> for tho he was to go in the month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he ſtill tarried at <hi>Mets</hi> until the end of the year.</p>
               <p>His firſt reſolution was, to ſend the Archbiſhop of <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe</hi> before into <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> and to make an Offer to Monſ. <hi>de St. Luc,</hi> to accompany the ſaid Archbiſhop in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the deſign the Queen-mother had to leave <hi>Blois;</hi> which was to be on the ſame day Monſ. <hi>d' Eſpernon</hi> was to paſs the <hi>Loire.</hi> But Monſ. <hi>d' Eſpernon</hi> alter'd his mind ſince.</p>
               <p>Being reſolved to ſet forward for <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> he ſent one of his Attendants to Court, to ſound Monſ. <hi>de Luynes</hi>'s Intention by his Friends, and to ſee whether they were diſpoſed to permit him to make this Journey without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Court, which he was no wiſe deſirous to do.</p>
               <p>The Perſon he ſent was order'd not to mention the permiſſion he deſired, unleſs he were ſure to obtain it.</p>
               <p>He applied himſelf to Monſ. <hi>de Bellegarde,</hi> who ſeemed to be in favour with Mr. <hi>de Luynes,</hi> and who being nearly related, and a particular Friend to Monſ. <hi>d' Eſpernon,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook that affair.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:42519:251"/>
               <p>He ſpoke to the Sieur <hi>Deagers</hi> about it, who engaged his Word to him, that the King would grant Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> a permiſſion to go to <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> in whatever form he deſired it: but inſtead of allowing the ſame, the King writ to him, That he judg'd his Preſence neceſſary about <hi>Mets,</hi> by reaſon of the Troubles of <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Anſwer did no leſs trouble Monſ. <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> than the Duke <hi>d'Eſpernon,</hi> inſomuch that Monſ. <hi>de Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde</hi> took this pretence to break off his Friendſhip pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly with <hi>Deagers,</hi> and preſt this Affair ſo cloſe, that he obtain'd a Letter from the King for Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon,</hi> by which his Majeſty indeed gave him Leave to purſue the Journey he deſired, but at the ſame time order'd him not to ſet forward till he heard farther from him.</p>
               <p>The obſcurity of this Permiſſion did not hinder Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> from purſuing the deſign of his Journey.</p>
               <p>In order thereunto, he ſet out on the 6th or 7th of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> in the year 1619. And tho he had reſolv'd before to leave the execution of the Enterprize of <hi>Blois</hi> to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> on the day he was to paſs the River <hi>Loire,</hi> he alter'd his mind, and reſolved to be there himſelf, for Reaſons too long to be inſerted here.</p>
               <p>He gave no notice of his departure to the ſaid Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> till he came to a place called <hi>Pont <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Vichy,</hi> whence he diſpatched a Gentleman to the King, to give him Reaſons for what he had done.</p>
               <p>After that, he ſtopt no where till he came to <hi>Confollant,</hi> where the Archbiſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> met him, with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his Government, which he had ſummoned.</p>
               <p>He remained there two or three days, uncertain what courſe to take; but after having taken the Advice of <hi>Ruccellai</hi> and <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> he ſent the latter Poſt to the Queen mother, and put forward the next day himſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards <hi>Loches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> at his arrival at <hi>Blois</hi> found the Queen-mother very impatient to hear from the Duke <hi>d'Eſpernon;</hi> for being inform'd that he was gone from <hi>Mets,</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given her notice of it by Letters, ſhe did not know what to impute that Neglect to.</p>
               <p>This was the reaſon that he found her ſo little prepar'd to leave <hi>Blois,</hi> that both <hi>Chanteloube</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Moſni</hi> were abſent, tho they were the only perſons ſhe was to make uſe of in that occaſion.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:42519:252"/>
               <p>A little before the ſaid <hi>du Pleſſis</hi>'s arrival, ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a very long Letter from <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> by which he endeavour'd to diſſwade her from putting her ſelf into Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi>'s hands, by reaſon of the ſingularity of his Humor, repreſenting to her, That ſhe could commit no greater fault, than to retire into any place under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>As for himſelf, indeed he offer'd to receive her into his Government of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> tho 'tis very likely that he was not very deſirous of it; but at the ſame time he excus'd himſelf from ſerving her, in caſe ſhe put her ſelf into Monſ. <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi>'s hands.</p>
               <p>This Letter did not hinder the Queen from proſecuting her firſt deſign, and from reſolving to leave <hi>Blois,</hi> without ſtaying either for the Marquis <hi>de Moſni,</hi> or for <hi>Chanteloube.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Treaty between Monfieur <hi>d'Eſpernon</hi> and the Queen mother was carried on in the beginning with a great deal of ſecrecy on his part; but towards the latter end it was known or ſuſpected by moſt of thoſe that were about him, and it is certain, that at his going from <hi>Confollaus</hi> all his Servants ſeeing him go back to <hi>Loches,</hi> ſaid publickly, that he was going to carry away the Queen-mother.</p>
               <p>But thoſe ſhe had intruſted with it kept the matter far leſs ſecret; for Monſieur <hi>de St. Luc</hi> paſſing through <hi>Blois,</hi> acquainted Mademoiſelle <hi>de Bains</hi> with all the particulars of it; and the Marquis <hi>de Moſui,</hi> from the beginning, ſpoke of it to Mademoiſelle <hi>de Talſy,</hi> before one of her Women, by whom Madam <hi>Bonuaeil</hi> and <hi>Sardini</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the matter.</p>
               <p>The thing ſucceeded nevertheleſs, and Monſieur <hi>de Luynes</hi> was either ſo careleſs, or ſo unhappy, as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the leaſt notice of a thing which was known by ſo many.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable in this place, that <hi>Chabanes</hi> was ſent to Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon,</hi> by Monſieur <hi>de Luynes,</hi> and that he paſſed through <hi>Loches</hi> two days before the ſaid Duke's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival there, without being inform'd of his Journey; ſo that he went very near <hi>Poictiers</hi> without hearing any thing about him. But tho the ſaid <hi>Chabanes</hi> had had notice of his departure from <hi>Confolaus</hi> at that time, and of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which was known by his attendance, as aboveſaid, it was too late to give Monſieur <hi>de Luynes</hi> a ſufficient no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof, to prevent the Queen-mothers eſcape from <hi>Blois,</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:42519:252"/>
               <p>But to reſume what the Queen was doing at <hi>Blois,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no body with her capable to ſerve her in her Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, ſhe detained <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> and left the management of all things to him.</p>
               <p>She took but one day to diſpoſe her ſelf to remove in the Night, and ordered the Count <hi>de Breyne, la Mazure,</hi> and <hi>Marce,</hi> Officers of her Guards, to be ready againſt the following Nights, becauſe ſhe had a mind to depart ſecretly from <hi>Blois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time ſhe ordered <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> to write to Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpernon,</hi> to deſire him to ſend the Archbiſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> and ſome of his Attendants to <hi>Montrichard</hi> to ſeize the Bridge, over which ſhe was obliged to paſs of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Archbiſhop repaired thither immediately with ſixteen Gentlemen and <hi>Ruccellai,</hi> who came <hi>incognito,</hi> as he had done during all the Journey.</p>
               <p>All things being thus prepared, the Queen came out of <hi>Blois</hi> in the Night, through one of the Windows of the Caſtle, by a Ladder, which Count <hi>de Breyne</hi> or <hi>la Mazure</hi> had prepared for her.</p>
               <p>She took but one of her Women along with her, whoſe Name was <hi>Catherine:</hi> Count <hi>de Breyne,</hi> and four of her Guards, ſtood waiting at the foot of the Ladder with <hi>du Pleſſes,</hi> who was to order all things.</p>
               <p>She was conſtrained to crawl along the Ditch, and to walk on foot to the other end of the Bridge of <hi>Blois,</hi> where her Coach waited for her.</p>
               <p>She ſtept into it, with one of her Women, her Jewels, and a Lantern, becauſe ſhe could not tarry in her Coach without a light, and came in this Equipage to <hi>Montrichard,</hi> where ſhe ſhifted her Coach and Horſes, and was met by <hi>Ruccellai</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Thoulouſe.</hi>

               <p>THe King, who, together with the general Good of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> reſpects the Advantage and Reputation of his Affairs abroad, as he is induſtrious to ſettle them at home with his Authority, by all poſſible means of Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and Care, where-ever it is required, has thought fit to fill up the Vacancy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Embaſſy, by a Perſon fitly qualified to ſerve him, and to pleaſe our holy Father the Pope, to watch and obſerve all publick Occurrences, and to promote the Honour and Service of his Majeſty in all things.</p>
               <p>To this end he has choſen the Bailiff <hi>de Sillery</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor in his Council of State, a Perſon very well known to his Majeſty by ſeveral Imployments and Commiſſions he has diſcharged to his ſatisfaction; and commands him forthwith to repair with all ſpeed towards <hi>Rome,</hi> about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral affairs, relating as much to the Peace of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> (equally reſpected by his Holineſs, and by his Majeſty) the Tranquility and Liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> as to the Welfare and Safety of the Friends and Allies of <hi>France;</hi> and has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this memorial to be drawn, to be the Rule and Guide of his Conduct, ſaving ſuch Orders and Commands as shall be ſent to him by his Majeſty in a more preciſe manner, by the uſual way, according as the new Accidents that may ariſe shall require it.</p>
               <p>It is his Majeſty's Pleaſure he should go through <hi>Turin,</hi> tho it were only (beſides that it is in his way) to viſit his Majeſty's Siſter in his Name, his Highneſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Princes and Princeſſes his Children, as alſo to acquaint the ſaid Duke in particular with his Majeſty's Sentiments upon the preſent Occurrences, and to aſſure him of his ſaid Majeſty's ſincere Friendſhip, which he is very deſirous
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42519:253"/>
to make him ſenſible of, by Effects, to his advantage and ſatisfaction. His Majeſty knows the Eſteem the late King his moſt honour'd Lord and Father ever had for his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and has made his late Majeſty's maxim his rule in the conduct of the General, as he was a wiſe Prince, endued with a long experience in Publick Affairs: He deſigns to live with the ſaid Duke in that ſtrict bond of Affection for their Common Intereſt, lately ſtrengthen'd by the dear Pledge his Majeſty has given the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> of his dear-beloved Siſter; declaring again, that as it has pleaſed God to let him take the management of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs into his own hands, and to direct them with a Will full of Equity and Honour, ſo the ſaid Duke, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo nearly related to him, shall freely share that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, from which his Majeſty expects to ſee effects ariſe one day uſeful to the Publick, favourable to his Friends, and acceptable to his Holineſs.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty is ſenſible that the ſaid Duke is deſirous, as well as himſelf, that every one should be maintained in his Right, to oppoſe all Uſurpations, and that Neighbors and Confederates living in a friendly manner, may keep ſo good a Correſpondence, that ſuch as would attempt any thing to the prejudice of ſo juſt a Reſolution, may feel the effects of their ambition and rashneſs, if ſo daring as to attempt it; or be kept within bounds, out of fear of the Force and Councils of the ſaid Aſſociates for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The preſent ſtate of affairs in <hi>Valtelina</hi> requires this to be urged to the ſaid Duke, who is likewiſe concerned for the Safety of <hi>Italy.</hi> The King has already acquainted him with the perpetual Endeavours uſed about it from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning, that his Majeſty prevents the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſuch a precipitated Uſurpation, to remonſtrate the Conſequences thereof, and to promote its reſtitution at <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and elſewhere, being deſirous at firſt, by mild means to endeavour the obtaining of an amicable Treaty, before he would proceed to thoſe of Rigor, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of reſpect to the Publick Peace, ſo juſtly valued and deſired; as alſo becauſe the Infringers thereof are ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to his Majeſty by <hi>Alliances,</hi> that he had reaſon to expect from their very Promiſes, that they would at laſt yield to his juſt Remonſtrances, to execute the Agreement made at <hi>Madrid,</hi> for the reſtitution of the ſaid Countries, as ſoon as might be, according to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles thereof. This has been preſt without intermiſſion

                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:42519:254"/>
thereby diſcovers his entire Affection for the Welfare of his Affairs, ſo he may aſſure himſelf that he ſhall have a good Share in the Succeſs thereof, which he hopes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and to ſettle by Power only.</p>
               <p>He alſo thinks it very neceſſary, once more to adviſe the ſaid Duke to facilitate, as much as in him lies, the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation between himſelf and the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hitherto by thoſe who envied his Majeſty the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of being the Promoter thereof, and would improve their diſſention to their own advantage. But both of them would do wiſely, conſidering the ends of their Neighbours, to yield ſomething in reſpect to the Publick Good and their Intereſt, rather than to hearken to the artificial Suggeſtions of thoſe who have and do ſtill endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep up their Diviſion. The ſaid Commandore is to enquire of the Sieur <hi>Marini,</hi> who is in thoſe parts, and will aſſiſt him in all things, on what Terms the ſaid Duke ſtands in that reſpect; and if his Majeſty's Name and Authority can be any wiſe ſerviceable therein, he is freely to employ himſelf in it, in his paſſage, as he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is to do at <hi>Rome,</hi> (where this Affair was formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd) when any occaſion ſhall offer it ſelf.</p>
               <p>He is to do the ſame Office towards the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> (without going thither himſelf) by ſending one of his Gentlemen to aſſure him of his Majeſty's Good-will of his being order'd to favour his Intereſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to facilitate their reconciliation; to which he ſhall be deſired to ſhow himſelf the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, ſeeing that the publick occaſions ſeem to invite them all to a ſpeedy and ſtrict reconciliation. He is alſo to complement him upon the late Marriage of the Princeſs his Siſter with the Emperor, wiſhing him and all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily all manner of Proſperity and Content therein.</p>
               <p>The King doubts not but the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Cardinal his Son, will put him upon the Subject of the Comprotection, which he has been too much mov'd and offended at, ſince his Majeſty, conſidering his quality, the nearneſs of his relation to him, and the place he has in his Affection, never had or could have the leaſt intention of doing any thing to his diſadvantage. When he honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> with the Title of Comprotector, it was not to equal him with the ſaid Cardinal of <hi>Savoy,</hi> being very ſenſible of the difference of their Birth, for he was expreſly enjoyn'd to yield to him in all things, and to meddle with nothing in his preſence, but what

remain as they are at preſent, than to make any Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſince none can be made without prejudice to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Affairs at <hi>Rome.</hi> Therefore if it were poſſible to divert the ſaid Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> from this thought, the ſaid Commander would do his Majeſty a ſignal piece of Service, the management of which is left to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſcretion, according as he will diſcover the Temper and Diſpoſition of the ſaid Cardinal, upon the Place as well as by <hi>Marini</hi>'s Informations.</p>
               <p>He is ſtill to confirm his Majeſty's Journey to <hi>Lyons,</hi> as well to pleaſe and comfort the Allies in the affair of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> as becauſe their Highneſſes have a great deſire to ſee and wait on his Majeſty; which when they mention, he is to aſſure them will be very acceptable to him. The ſaid Commander is alſo to aſſure the Princeſs, his Siſter, of his Majeſty's cordial Love and fraternal Affection, and that whenever any occaſion ſhall offer it ſelf to give proofs thereof, he will embrace it with great ſatisfaction; that he rejoyces at the good and honourable Treatment ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, and will allways be ready to do her all manner of good offices towards the ſaid Duke, and the Prince, his Son; he is likewiſe to acquaint her with the charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he has re-iterated to the aforeſaid <hi>Marini,</hi> to let him hear often from her, and what confidence his Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in his devotion to his ſervice. He is alſo to viſit the other Princes and Infanta's whom he is to complement, and to aſſure them of his Majeſty's Friendſhip and Good-will. And without making any longer ſtay there, he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> through <hi>Florence,</hi> as it is uſual; where his Majeſty is perſuaded that he will be kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the Great Duke, the Great Dutcheſs Dowager, and the Widow Arch-Dutcheſs. At the delivery of his Majeſty's Letters, he is to renew the Declarations of his Good-Will, which they have lately receiv'd from Father <hi>Arbinot,</hi> Confeſſor to the Great Dutcheſs; and after having perform'd the uſual Duties, Aſſurances of Friendſhip, and of ſavouring their Affairs where he is going to reſide: He is not to forget, before his departure from thence, to reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Inſtances that have often been made concerning his Majeſty's Money, carry'd thither by the late <hi>Concini,</hi> which is juſtly due to him, by reaſon that the ſums drawn from <hi>Rome</hi> are but ſlight and inconſiderable in proportion thereunto; and to acquaint them that a longer detention of the ſaid Money might create miſunderſtandings, as it has already been declar'd and fully prov'd to Father <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:42519:255"/>
in order to make their Highneſſes ſinſible thereof, that according to their Equity, and the good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they deſire to hold with his Majeſty, they may have a due regard to his right, and to the deſire they ought to have to cultivate and maintain the ſame carefully. The particulars hereof ſhall be explain'd by word of Mouth to the ſaid Commander, that he may be the better able to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue about it; and he is to inquire and receive a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular information in his Journey from the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> of what he has done and Negociated heretofore in the like caſe at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is alſo to take care to let them know the perfect Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and good Intelligence that is between his Majeſty and the Queen Mother, (in which that Houſe of <hi>Medicis</hi> is highly concern'd) which has always been one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's moſt earneſt deſires, as a duty to which he is oblig'd both by God and Nature, as well as by the reciprocal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he receives from the ſaid Queen his Mother, who is heartily ſorry that the artificial Impreſſions and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Councils of Perſons who endeavour'd to improve their Diviſion to their own advantage, have laſted ſo long. But that having through the Grace of God diſcover'd the Truth, and the Malice of the Authors and Contrivers of a courſe ſo prejudicial, ſhe has reſum'd her former Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Majeſty's mild and truly Royal Temper, whoſe Soul rejoices thereat, and will ever ſtudy by all the means and duties of filial Reſpect, to confirm her ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to her ſatisfaction. And in order to give the World a very evident proof thereof, the King has lately admitted the ſaid Queen again into his Council, and moſt ſecret affairs, to be aſſiſted with her good advice upon all occaſions.</p>
               <p>He is to obſerve in what manner this repreſentation will be receiv'd at <hi>Florence,</hi> and the Judgment they will make of his Majeſty's behaviour towards the ſaid Queen, to give his Majeſty notice thereof, that he may the better and more ſecurely regulate his Conduct upon that knowledge for the future. For really he has not had much reaſon to be ſatisfy'd with their Highneſſes of late, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the reſtitution of the Money of the ſaid <hi>Concini;</hi> their manner of proceeding therein, which the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lyons</hi> is very well acquainted, with, being as unſeemly, as diſpleaſing to his Majeſty, which was acknowledg'd by <hi>Arbinot</hi> himſelf. If any of the Miniſters ſhould put him upon this ſubject, he may inform them, that the matter

is very well known, and that it cannot long remain in thoſe terms, which may be remedy'd by a ſpeedy pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid Money.</p>
               <p>Before his Arrival at <hi>Rome,</hi> he is to inform Cardinal <hi>de Sourdis</hi> of his coming, if he be ſtill there, to confer with him before his entry into the ſaid City, about the form thereof, or elſe with Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> who is Compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector there: He is to make it as Honourable and Solemn as can be, according to the uſual Cuſtom; to get informations from them about the general ſtate of Affairs, and of his Majeſty's in particular; what he is do to at this beginn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and to learn from them, as perſons better inform'd with the uſe of the Country, how he is to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be admitted the very firſt Night of his Arrival to kiſs his Holineſſes Feet; to whom, preſenting the King's Letters written with his own hand, he is to confirm the aſſurances of his Majeſty's Affectionate and Filial Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, for the Service and Honour of the Holy See, by the Example of the Kings, his Predeceſſors, to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his Beatitude, and the advantage of his houſe and deſigns. He is alſo to make him ſenſible of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folation his Majeſty receiv'd at his aſſumption to the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate; his Prayers having been granted on this ſubject: Since it has pleas'd God to give a Perſon of his Piety and Virtue to Chriſtendom, who has the intentions, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with all the Qualifications requir'd in a common Father; that it is his earneſt deſire he may injoy it long for the Publick Good, which he will again confirm to him, at the ſending him the uſual Devoirs and Obedience. That his Majeſty is perſuaded that his Holineſs puts a greater confidence in this Royal Freedom, and in the real and ſolid Effects, his Majeſty daily diſcovers to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Church, and of Chriſtendom in General, than to impute his not having been able hitherto to perform that duty to the leaſt want of Inclination or Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Beatitude, but to the Troubles and Diviſions of his Kingdom, which he has begun to diſintangle ſo happily, and ſo much to the advantage of the Catholick Religion, and of his Authority; that his Majeſty is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that he will prefer ſuch ſalutory Effects to a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Duty, ſince his Majeſty yields to none, beſides his Title of firſt Son of the Church, in Duty or Devotion towards the Holy See and his Holineſs, as he will ever make it appear both at Home and Abroad; and that he hopes that God will bleſs him ſo much again this Year,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42519:257"/>
either by Agreement, or Force of Arms, as to extend the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion, and the Honour of the Name of God in his Kingdom, ſo far as to deſerve the Continuation of the good Will and Paternal Counſels His Holineſs has ſent him upon that Subject; which, his Nuncio can aſſure him, have been receiv'd by him with Sentiments ſuitable to his Zeal, and to the Reſpect he bears to whatever proceeds from the wiſe Counſels of His Beatitude.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Commandore is to remain within theſe Bounds at his firſt private Audience, only giving His Holineſs Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of His Majeſty's Devotion, according to the uſual Cuſtom. For, as to other Affairs, they are referr'd to that which is to be ſolemn and publick, as well as others which will be given him from time to time, according as Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ſhall offer themſelves. He is to wait on Cardinal <hi>Ludoviſio,</hi> His Holineſs's Nephew, the ſame Night; whom he is to acquaint with His Majeſty's Good Will towards him; the Confidence he repoſes in, and Knowledge he has of his Affection for the Welfare of his Affairs; in which he ſhall be deſir'd to perſevere, and to make his Uncle fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable in ſuch Occaſions as ſhall occurr during his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in <hi>Rome:</hi> Which His Majeſty will be ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to his Advantage and Satisfaction, on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by profitable and honourable Effects.</p>
               <p>The greateſt and moſt important Affair in debate at this time is that above-mention'd about <hi>Valtelina,</hi> which his Holineſs is very well acquainted with, together with the Endeavours hitherto us'd by his Majeſty, to ſtifle the Misfortunes he is ſenſible muſt ariſe from that Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their very birth. He is again to lay the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſequences thereof before his Holineſs, in relation to the publick Good of <hi>Italy,</hi> and even of the <hi>Roman</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelf; and that unleſs the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will ſpeedily ſubmit to his Counſels, and paternal Exhortations, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the Reſtitution thereof, the King will be oblig'd to eſpouſe the Cauſe and Intereſt of his Allies; that his Holineſs is not only oblig'd, as a common Father, to prevent Troubles, but as a Temporal Prince of <hi>Italy</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate and oppoſe all manner of Uſurpations. His Majeſty in this point only requires the Obſervation and Execution of the Articles of <hi>Madrid,</hi> made with the approbation of his Holineſs's Miniſters; the accompliſhing of which the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> under a ſpecious pretence of Religion towards him, and of deference towards ſeveral Princes and States concern'd, have delay'd and put off; inſomuch that the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42519:258"/>
Diſtemper is now grown to ſuch a head, by the artifice and deſire of the Governor of <hi>Millan,</hi> to preſerve what he has Uſurp'd againſt all Right and Reaſon, to the prejudice of his Majeſty's Alliance, and of the ſafety of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> that his Majeſty has freely declar'd, and lately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain acquainted his Holineſs, his Nuncio, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dor, that unleſs the aforeſaid Agreement were ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually perform'd, he could no longer reſiſt the deſires and general Intereſt of his Confederates, who made earneſt Sollicitations to him to aſſiſt and ſtrengthen them with his generous Reſolutions in their preſſing need, and that on their ſides they would co-operate to the utmoſt of their Power and Intereſt: That in compliance thereunto his Majeſty has ſent Orders in all parts to keep all things in readineſs; and that being reſolv'd to repair to <hi>Lyons,</hi> his Orders were alſo diſpatch'd to the Marſhal <hi>d' Eſdigureres,</hi> to be ready at the firſt Command. That it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Princes concern'd, and ſeveral others who will not ſtir until they ſee the Game begun, will freely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Liſts for their preſervation, others for Intereſt, and that then his Holineſs, though perhaps too late, will find whether the Reaſons alledg'd by <hi>Spain</hi> for Religion, are as important and conſiderable, as the Evils and Accidents which will ariſe to his grief, even to the very detriment of the Catholick Religion. For undoubtedly ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes will make this Cauſe theirs, being jealous, with reaſon, of the growing greatneſs of <hi>Spain,</hi> and divers Nations and Religions will enter and fill <hi>Italy.</hi> And all this is occaſion'd by the immoderate Covetouſneſs and Ambition of the Miniſters of <hi>Spain;</hi> the prejudice and blame whereof will fall upon the Authors, and his Majeſty will be ſufficiently diſcharg'd towards God and Men, by the Endeavours he has us'd to prevent theſe Misfortunes; for conſidering the time when the Enterprize was firſt began, and the Treaty concluded upon that Subject, but not executed by <hi>Spain,</hi> a longer patience would be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to want of Courage and Reſentment. Therefore his Majeſty again intreats his Holineſs, ſeriouſly to renew the Efforts of his paternal Admonition, to prevent ſuch Calamities. His Majeſty is very ſenſible that the ſaid <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> the better to colour and juſtify their Attempts, and to make him the more favourable to their Deſign, have all along laid the Caſe of Religion before his Eyes, to blind him, and conſequently prevent his joining with the reſt of the Allies, or at leaſt to make him connive at
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42519:258"/>
their Enterprize: But whereas the Mask is now thrown off, and that it is evident by other Occurrences in <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> that they are induc'd thereunto more out of Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than Religion, his Holineſs muſt be intreated no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſuffer himſelf to be impos'd on, both for his own Honour, and for the good and peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> as well as for the ſake of the Catholick Religion; the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of which, he may aſſure himſelf, his Majeſty will ever be one of the firſt to promote with all his power. But there is ſome danger, (as it has often been repreſented) in being too obſtinate for one, of loſing both together. For it is moſt certain, that the ſaid Leagues of the <hi>Griſons</hi> are not oblig'd, by the Articles of the Treaty, to maintain the Catholick Religion alone in <hi>Valtelina;</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cannot inſiſt on this, without a Breach of the Treaty, and without wounding his Majeſty's Royal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion. But moreover to remove this borrow'd Veil, and to go beyond them by a Zeal not apparent, but truly ſincere of Religion, though this be not included in the ſaid Agreement, he will imploy his Credit and lively Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances towards the ſaid <hi>Griſons</hi> by his Ambaſſadors, and uſe all other reaſonable means to prevail with them for the preſervation of the ſaid Religion in <hi>Valtelina,</hi> though not in the nature of a Condition, as aboveſaid; it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mention'd in the Treaty, and they being oblig'd, notwithſtanding a refuſal to accompliſh the ſaid Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to perform the ſaid full and intire Reſtitution. That in caſe his Majeſty can ſucceed in this deſign, it will be a great comfort to his Holineſs, whoſe Nuncio in <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi> muſt be order'd to facilitate with his Majeſty's Miniſters, all honeſt and ſure means to haſten the ſaid R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. His Majeſty preſſes this Affair, being juſtly preſs'd by the thing it ſelf, and by the Perſons concern'd therein, which ſhould invite his Holineſs to double his vigilance and ſerious Inſtances in <hi>Spain;</hi> otherwiſe he will find, by real Effects, that his Majeſty's foreſight has been good, and his care in ſo many places very praiſe worthy.</p>
               <p>But in order the better to convince his Holineſs of the truth of the premiſſes, here is a very certain and moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Argument thereof. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who boaſt, and ſeem very deſirous of promoting the good and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Catholick Religion in <hi>Germany,</hi> where they had promis'd to Inveſt the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> with both the <hi>Palatinates,</hi> are now out of Reaſons of State more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd

in the matter; out of fear of diſpleaſing the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and leſt the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſhould grow too powerful in <hi>Germany;</hi> Cauſes altogether Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, which hinder them from advancing the Glory and Holy Name of God in ſo fair an occaſion; while his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhows himſelf more inclinable and favourable to it; for though the Elector <hi>Palatin</hi> is Ally'd to him, he knows in his Soul what he has done on that ſubject, where it was neceſſary to ſhow his good intention. His Holineſs's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and his Nuncio here, have diſcover'd it themſelves, and that it was only a Blind u'sd by them, to abuſe the moſt ſimple, but not capable of obſcuring the prudence and clear ſight of his Holineſs, who will be prais'd and bleſs'd by God and Men, for endeavouring to prevent U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations, and to maintain the publick Peace, which are the only Ends his Majeſty propoſes. But the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandore is chiefly to inſiſt on the Miſchiefs that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue for the Publick, theſe Crowns proceeding to a Breach, (which his Majeſty will prevent to the utmoſt of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,) by the advantages the <hi>Turk</hi> will eaſily gain by the diviſion of the Chriſtian Princes. Whereas being united, as it is his Holineſs's Office to keep them, and to which his Piety, and other good Conſiderations, ſhould incline him above all things, conſidering the preſent ſtate of the <hi>Turks;</hi> great progreſſes might be made againſt them. But our Sins and Diſcords making us unworthy of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we muſt implore the goodneſs of God, and his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by Prayers and Exhortations muſt uſe his utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, to reconcile the hearts of Chriſtian Princes to an Enterprize ſo holy, ſo important, and ſo ſeaſible at this time, according to the knowledge the King has of the now State of the Grand Seignor's Affairs and Provinces. This buſineſs of <hi>Valtelina</hi> being adjuſted, before which nothing can be reſolved on, if his Holineſs finds a good Diſpoſition in other Princes, His Majeſty will ever be ready to ſecond his good Intentions, and to promote them to the utmoſt of his power. It is His Majeſty's Deſire, that the Honour of a Deſign ſo pious, and ſo full of Glory, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to the Happineſs of this Pontificate; and that, in order thereunto, His Holineſs would be pleas'd to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his beſt Endeavours for the Pacification of the Troubles of <hi>Italy,</hi> as well as thoſe that are kindling in <hi>Germany;</hi> that the chief Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> having no other Quarrels to decide, may be the better able to unite their Wills and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:42519:259"/>
               <p>His Majeſty is very ſenſible that none are ſo buſie on the Stage of the World, as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in order to extend their Empire more and more; which will not only be the Occaſion of neglecting the Opportunities of this Chriſtian Project, but alſo of uniting the Proteſtant Princes more ſtrictly to oppoſe the Projects of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> And while this Game laſts, the <hi>Turk</hi> will have many fair Occaſions to improve it, to their Coſt and Shame; and the <hi>Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Emperor having re-gain'd <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which had been taken from him, ſeems to have more Cauſe to let his Arms reſt, in order to provide againſt this common Enemy, than to ſatisfie the Paſſion of another, who leads him under his Authority to a Deſign which keeps him in Servitude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and makes him ſhare the publick Loſs. For here is Work cut out for a long time, unleſs the Parties will put an end to it themſelves; ſince there is Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> with his Confederates, will not let his Son-in-Law periſh; and that the States-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> will neither be ſo weak, nor ſo deſtitute of Friends, and of Aſſiſtance, as to fall ſo ſoon by the Efforts of the Arms of <hi>Spain.</hi> And in the mean time the great Occaſions of doing good, as to the general, ſlip away, Princes weaken each other by vexatious, bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Exerciſes; thereby giving great Advantages to a potent Enemy, who is only with-held by his Ignorance of our Condition, or by the Hand of God, who, in his Mercy, has not yet given us over to his Wrath. But we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear, that the Continuance of this Misfortune will draw it upon us, as being too unworthy of his Favours, in not having made uſe of the fair Opportunities he had given us, of making great Progreſſes againſt this Enemy, in theſe laſt Ages.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Commandore is alſo to enquire of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals <hi>de Sourdis</hi> and <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> on what Terms the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage propos'd between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ſtands at preſent, not to raiſe the leaſt Obſtacle againſt it, His Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had ſeveral Occaſions ſo to do, ſince he firſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of it, had he been ſo pleas'd, but only to give him a conſtant Account thereof; His Majeſty having no Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the matter, provided the Catholick Religion be thereby promoted; he preferring that Conſideration to all the Policies that can occurr upon this Account, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps others would not deal with ſo much Candour towards
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42519:260"/>
him. But whereas his Majeſty is of Opinion, that this propoſition of Alliance is only to gain time, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove occaſions on both ſides, as it appears ſufficiently by all their proceedings in relation to the general affairs in which they are concern'd; ſo his Majeſty thinks fit not to trouble himſelf any further with it, but to refer it all to the Prudences and wiſe Conſideration of his Beatitude.</p>
               <p>Who muſt needs be ſenſible, by the good Offices lately done at <hi>Venice,</hi> for the reſtauration of the Jeſuits in their Demean, what care his Majeſty takes to promote what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tends towards his Holineſs's ſatisfaction, who has expreſs'd a great deal of concern in this Affair, as a thing tending to the ſervice of God, the honour of which might have been rais'd, had the Republick been pleas'd to adhere to his Holineſs's and his Majeſty's good Councils and Salutery Remonſtrances. And though his Majeſty has ſome reaſon to be disſatisfy'd with the refuſal he has incur'd at his Holineſſes Intreaty, he having expos'd his Name and Dignity in this Buſineſs, contrary to his firſt intentions; fore-ſeeing this reſiſtance from the Seignory; Nevertheleſs, in order to do well in all things, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any reaſonable likelihood of ſucceſs ſhall appear in the iſſue of the ſaid Recommendation, his Majeſty will freely undertake it a new: But at preſent his Majeſty is of Opinion, that it is proper to refer it to another Seaſon, when time ſhall have made the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſenſible of the fault they have committed, and of the misfortunes which may ariſe in their State, by the Baniſhment of the ſaid Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>If his Holineſs ſhould put the ſaid Commandore upon the ſubject of the Enterpriſe of <hi>Geneva,</hi> to which he has lately invited his Majeſty by a perſon ſent on purpoſe, he is to make him ſenſible, according as it has already been freely declar'd to his Nuncio, and to Father <hi>Barnabite,</hi> ſent on purpoſe on that ſubject, that this would be directly contrary to the deſign his Majeſty has propos'd to himſelf in this Kingdom, to remove the Opinion which ſome malicious perſons publiſh, that by the War he makes againſt his rebellious Subjects, he aims at their Religion, and not at the Faction, which would make them all Unite again, not only in <hi>France,</hi> but thoſe of the ſame Sect out of the Kingdom, who hitherto have only been Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this Tragedy, which the ſaid Revolters have been the cauſe of, his Majeſty having all along told and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd them, that without reſpect to Religion he only
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42519:260"/>
attacks Diſobedience, and that if any of his Catholick Subjects ſhould lay aſide their Allegiance, he would uſe them in the ſame manner, for the good of the publick Peace, and for the ſecurity of his Authority. Had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to this Enterprize againſt <hi>Geneva,</hi> theſe publick Cauſes failing, he would be at a loſs for the proſecution of this project, which is in ſuch forwardneſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the ſaid <hi>Nuncio</hi> and the Miniſters of <hi>Savoy</hi> have preſs'd him upon that affair, they have ſound the ſolidity of his Reaſons by his Anſwers, beſides the reaſons of State which his Majeſty does not alledge at this time, and which have always been held in great conſideration by the late King, his Father, when the ſaid Duke, as he has often done, has propos'd the ſaid deſign. But poſſibly he has thought, that his Majeſty being imploy'd at home, could not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily divert him from the ſaid deſign, or that his Holineſs would have more power to perſuade him.</p>
               <p>If the Duke ſpeaks to the ſaid Commandore about it, he is to make the ſame anſwer to him, and that his Majeſty for theſe Reaſons, which have been known to him hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, cannot agree to the ſaid Enterprize; and that when he has put a good order to his Affairs, according to his good beginning, it will then be more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſie for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve about it, and to conſider of means to favour his Highneſſes deſigns, who at this time would do better to joyn with his Holineſs, to ſeek out and propoſe good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients to promote the advancement of his Majeſty's good deſign in his Kingdom; the rather, becauſe the ſecurity of his Neighbours, and the Publick Peace, partly depends on the good Condition thereof, by the counterpoiſe every body knows his Majeſty's power keeps againſt other Kings and States, which might make attempts to the prejudice of the Common Liberty.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Commandore is alſo to repreſent, that his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs has good informations thereof: his Majeſty's happy Progreſſes the laſt Year, and the advantage he has gain'd by the reduction of upwards of Sixty Garriſons; his being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to proſecute his Fortune a great deal farther, yet unleſs the ſaid Revolters ſubmit to their Duty of their own accord, on ſuch conditions and ſubmiſſions as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd from Subjects to Soveraigns. That he is perſuaded, that as God has been pleas'd hitherto to favour his Arms, he will ſtill aſſiſt him for the future, ſince he has no other end, but the maintaining of his Authority, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of Religion under the favour of the Edicts, as
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42519:261"/>
much as juſtice and their behaviour will permit him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ready to march under the protection of God, whom he intreats his Holineſs to implore for him, as he has hitherto done, in order to proſecute the ſucceſs of his juſt and pious deſign. And the ſaid Commandore is to take care to acquaint his ſaid Holineſs with his Majeſty's Moral and Pious Life, a true example for his Age, to all other Kings. He aſſures himſelf that God will grant the Vows and Prayers of his Holineſs, and of all his Majeſty's good Subjects, thus following the paths of Honour and Vertue; which gives hopes, beſides, that being ſeconded by his Holineſs's good Advice, he will daily fructify for the better, and employ thoſe advantages beſtow'd on him by Providence, to the Honour of his Holy Name, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the benefit of the Chriſtian Common-wealth. And it is highly important for the promotion of this good Work, that it be favour'd, and that all the World may know that it was undertaken by the Authority of his Holineſs; his Predeceſſors having loſt many favourable occaſions to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the publick good for want of ſo doing. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty expects from the Juſtice and Wiſdom of his Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that making his profit of their Faults and Omiſſions in what relates to him, he will be more careful of it, and will look upon him as the moſt Chriſtian King, firſt Son of the Church, who in his private and publick Conduct aims at nothing, but the Exaltation of the Holy Name of God, Equity, and the general Good and Peace of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Theſe things appear particularly in the Actions which are done in the ſight of all the World, and eſpecially in the promotions of Cardinals, in which ſome things having been wanting in his Predeceſſor, he hopes they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd and mended by the Prudence and Goodneſs of his Holineſs, as indeed it would be, might the two Perſons heretofore recommend, <hi>viz.</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Luſſon,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> be included in the ſame promotion, according to the requeſt already made to his Holineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it in his Majeſty's Name, by the Cardinal <hi>de Sourdis;</hi> But the ſaid Commandore is no otherwiſe to inſiſt upon it for fear of Engaging the King's Dignity too far again, in caſe of a refuſal, which is apparent enough, and that he will grant but one to his Majeſty in the next Promotion; in which caſe he deſires it may be the ſaid Biſhop of <hi>Luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> to gratify the Queen his Mothers deſire, who behaves her ſelf ſo well towards him, that he will be glad of any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42519:261"/>
to pleaſure and oblige her. His Holineſs ſeems to be in Expectation of other Vacancies to favour Princes with; if not, he muſt but ſlightly intreat him to advance the ſaid Promotion, in reſpect to the affection his Majeſty bears to the ſaid Queen, his Mother.</p>
               <p>The Marquiſs <hi>de Caeuvres</hi> had orders gently to ſound the intention of the late Pope on this ſubject, in favour of Monſieur <hi>de Mets,</hi> his Natural Brother, but as he took ſpecial care not to preſs it in his Majeſty's Name, for fear of expoſing him to an abſolute refuſal; the ſaid Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore is to follow the ſame Method, in not making the like propoſitions for the Future, without firſt giving notice thereof, in order to receive his Majeſty's further Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands about it.</p>
               <p>Who wiſhes his Holineſs a long Pontificat, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and honour of the Church of God, and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good. But whereas his Beatitude is of a pretty weak Conſtitution, and like others ſubject to the Common Law, if any miſchance ſhould happen to his Perſon during the ſaid Commandore's reſidence at <hi>Rome,</hi> in caſe he could not have time to receive his Majeſty's more preciſe Orders on this Subject, he thinks fit to acquaint him that he has no other deſire than to ſee that ſupreme Dignity ſupply'd by a Perſon, knowing in all things the Office and Duty of a common Father without any Affection, Intereſt, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, but for the common good of all and general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. This is to ſerve as a rule for the ſaid Commandore, without preſcribing any thing more particularly to him in this caſe, which depends more from the Holy Ghoſt than from the will or affections of Men. Nevertheleſs as far as humanly may be done, it is his Majeſty's deſire that it may be a ſubject born on the Territorys belonging to the Church, ſo that all ſuſpicions being remov'd, all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Princes and States may make their applications there with more confidence and freedom, upon all thoſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which occur ſo frequently in the World, in which their Dignities and Qualifications rever'd by all men, have always been of great Weight, and have often ſupply'd the defects of the Parties to bring them to reaſon. Which when it ſhall happen the ſaid Commandore is to conſult with the ſaid Cardinals and other Perſons, well affected to the ſervice of <hi>France,</hi> and he is to uſe ſuch care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence therein, to the utmoſt of his Power, as may ſhew that his Majeſty conſiders no intereſt therein, but that in which God and the publick is concern'd. Nevertheleſs,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42519:262"/>
foreſeeing all Accidents, as much as in him lies, and in thoſe that ſerve the King, he is to project his deſign at a diſtance, and with ſecrecy, for it would prove prejudicial being divulg'd.</p>
               <p>And whereas tho' it is uſual and expedient to mind the preſent, yet it would be imprudent to neglect the other parts, ſince His Majeſty has no other End or Intereſt, but the publick Good. Therefore, as the ſaid Commandore, by his Conduct and Behaviour towards the Pope and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Ludoviſio,</hi> is, to give them all the Reaſon imaginable to commend His Majeſty's Intentions, and to make uſe of all Occaſions that may occurr; ſo he is likewiſe, as much as Diſcretion and Intereſt will permit him, to manage the Good Will of Cardinal <hi>Borgheſe,</hi> and his Faction; but with ſo much Addreſs and Temper, that the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may take no Umbrage thereat; in ſuch a manner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, that both he and his ſaid Faction may have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope His Majeſty's Protection and Favour in caſe of Need.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty's Ambaſſadors, and his Miniſters elſewhere, have always taken care of what relates to the Intereſts and Affairs of the Religion of <hi>Maltha,</hi> who has had Recourſe to His Majeſty's Authority in time of need; he having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo receiv'd ſeveral good Offices and Services from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Great Maſter, in Matters concerning his Subjects. Therefore His Majeſty enjoins him to continue his ſaid Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and Care for them, if needful, His Majeſty being perſuaded that the ſaid Commandore, by his Profeſſion of the ſaid Order, as well as by his Command, will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually fulfil the ſame.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty is inform'd, that a certain League has been propos'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> between the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of preſerving the Catholick Religion, and of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Coming in of Hereticks; but in effect, under this Colour, to invade their Liberties; it being very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the ſaid Overture was only made to obſtruct the Deliverance of <hi>Vatlelina,</hi> and of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> from the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions impos'd upon them. And therefore the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of <hi>Venice</hi> has rejected the ſaid Propoſitions, perceiving the Drift of thoſe that have made it; neither is it like to ſucceed. The ſaid Commandore is to keep an Eye over it, that in caſe the like Occaſion ſhou'd offer it ſelf during his Embaſſy, he may prevent the Effect of it, as prejudicial to the Safety of the Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> and artificially varniſh'd, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ull them aſleep inſenſibly, and to ſurpriſe them.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:42519:262"/>
               <p>The King is very ſorry that the Penſions given to ſome Cardinals and Prelates at <hi>Rome,</hi> have not been paid better of late; which has been occaſion'd by the Troubles of the Kingdom, and the immence Charge His Hajeſty has been at: But particular Care will be taken for the future, for the Payment thereof; which the ſaid Commandore may give them full Aſſurances of, that they may have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Encouragement and Reaſon to perſevere in the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they expreſs for His Majeſty's Service, in order to make uſe of it according as Occaſions ſhall offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> as the Perſon in whom His Majeſty confides moſt, and who is well acquainted with the Affairs of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Affection of thoſe that eſpouſe the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> will give the ſaid Commandore a particular Account thereof, that he may regulate himſelf accordingly, and be able to diſtinguiſh the one from the other. He is to expreſs His Majeſty's Satisfaction to him, for his Services; and that he knows he has been croſs'd in them by powerful Adverſaries, to prejudice him; but that he muſt endeavour to overcome thoſe Obſtacles by his good Conduct, and by getting as much Credit in the Palace as he can, to render his Talent the more profitable to the King, and to deſtroy the malicious Reports that have been ſpread to his Prejudice.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>de Sourdis</hi> and he, will acquaint him on what Terms the Affair between thoſe of the Congregation of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> and the Fathers of the Oratory ſtands, in order to apply ſuch Remedies and Moderation as will be requiſite in the Caſe, jointly with them, for His Majeſty's Service and Satisfaction; who is very well ſatisfied that thoſe of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Lorrain</hi> have obſtructed the Execution thereof. The ſaid Commandore is to take care to have the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy'd ſpeedily, by His Majeſty's Authority. And not to enter any further into ſeveral trivial Affairs, which do not deſerve being inſerted in an Inſtruction: He ſhall be inform'd there on what Terms they ſtand, and ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf therein, according to the Time and Occaſions, to the beſt of his power.</p>
               <p>And for as much as the good Fathers <hi>Minimes</hi> of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Mount</hi> have always been recommended to His Majeſty's Ambaſſadors, in order to their being preſerv'd in the Purity of Life they have choſen and continued with great Praiſe; and that none but thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> Nation may be receiv'd in the ſaid Monaſtery, into which ſome Foreigners have ſlip'd heretofore, who were not rightly
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42519:263"/>
qualified for the ſame, the ſaid Commandore is to take a particular Care of them.</p>
               <p>He is often to viſit the Cardinals of the ſacred Colledge in the uſual manner; and is to be very careful to give each of them aſſurances of his Majeſty's Favour according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their affection for the King's affairs, which he ſhall be acquainted with by thoſe of <hi>Sourdis</hi> and of <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> in order to confirm the Votaries of <hi>France</hi> in their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to endeavour by good Offices and Courteſies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Dignity, to encreaſe their Number.</p>
               <p>There has been ſome diſorder of late in the Taxes of Benefices, which has ſomewhat burthen'd his Majeſty's Subjects; the ſaid Commandore is to conferr with thoſe that are intelligent in thoſe affairs, about means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the ſame, making uſe of his Majeſty's Name and Credit, according as he ſhall think it convenient.</p>
               <p>As this Embaſſy has ever been look'd upon as the moſt honourable and moſt conſiderable, in reſpect to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Reputation and the wellfare of his Affairs (as it is the firſt in Rank) ſo his Majeſty is fully perſuaded that the ſaid Commandore's Conduct will produce Effects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting to the Grandeur of his Royal Name, the Publick Good, and his Holineſſes Satisfaction, by his deportment, which he is to make as acceptable as can be, preſerving what is due to his Majeſty's Dignity, that he may have as much cauſe to commend the ſaid Commandore's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, as the choice he has made of his Perſon, for the knowledge he has of his paſt Actions, and to reward him for the ſame to his Satisfaction.</p>

                  <hi>From M.</hi> du Puy<hi>'s Study, M.S.</hi> 478.</head>
               <p>THERE is no account to be given of the Treatment Cardinals receive in all other Kingdoms, where Kings give them the Precedency before all others whatever. But <hi>France</hi> having peculiar Laws to which it is reaſonable to ſubmit, they pretend to no more there than what they have had for the time paſt; and I am perſuaded that the World will commend their Modeſty, if they conſider that they freely ſuffer ſome diminution of the firſt rank they have had, out of reſpect to the Blood of their Majeſtys.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1467. at the Eſtates of <hi>Tours,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Balue</hi> was ſeated on the King's Right Hand, and <hi>Rene,</hi> King of <hi>Sicilly,</hi> Prince of the Blood on the left.</p>
               <p>In 1493. <hi>du Tillet</hi> Reports, That the King ſitting in his Parliament, the Cardinal of <hi>Lyons,</hi> was ſeated immediately after the Dukes of <hi>Orleans</hi> and of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the King's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and after him the Counts <hi>d' Angouleſme</hi> and <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencier,</hi> Princes of the Blood.</p>
               <p>The Poſſeſſion of this Rank has been ſo clear, that <hi>du Tillet</hi> ſays in expreſs Terms, that the Quality of a Cardinal is ſuch, that he preceeds all the Princes of the Blood, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſecond Perſon.</p>
               <p>The firſt conteſt between the Princes of the Blood and the Cardinals, happen'd under <hi>Charles</hi> the 9th. not between a lay Prince of the Blood, but between the Cardinal of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was the moſt Ancient, and was ſeated in the Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the other, without any Conteſtation. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Enemies, and it was fear'd that the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain</hi> would become too great in the State. Therefore in order to Temper and Humble the ſaid Houſe, the precedence was given to the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> after his having declar'd that he only pretended that Rank in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42519:265"/>
the Council, upon the account of the intereſt thoſe of the Blood have in the State above others.</p>
               <p>Since that time, there have been diſputes ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Princes of the Blood and the Cardinals in the Council. But without the leaſt Contradiction, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals have always preceeded all others.</p>
               <p>And it would be without the leaſt ground or reaſon, ſhould any Conſtable or Chancelor pretend to diſpute the ſaid Rank with a Cardinal, ſince they have ever been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by Perſons, who do not diſpute it with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Du Tillet</hi> reports, pag. 439. in a Seſſions of Parliament, That the Conſtable was ſeated after the Dukes of <hi>Guiſe, d' Aumalle</hi> and <hi>Vaudemont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In another Seſſions under <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. after the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In another Seſſions under the ſaid <hi>Henry,</hi> after the Dukes of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Aumalle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet in another, after the Dukes of <hi>Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe</hi> and of <hi>Nivernois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He alſo ſays elſewhere in expreſs words, That the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates are after the Conſtables or Chancellors, unleſs they are Princes or Cardinals.</p>
               <p>Under <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. the Conſtable, <hi>Anne de Montmorency</hi> was Favourite. He did not love the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and yet he never thought of diſputing his Rank.</p>
               <p>Since the Cardinal of <hi>Lenoncourt</hi> has always been ſeated in the King's Council above the Lord Keeper, officiating the place of Chancelor.</p>
               <p>At the Declaration of the Queen's Regency in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament held in the Monaſtery of the <hi>Auguſtin Fryars,</hi> the Conſtable of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> ſeated himſelf after the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of <hi>Joyeuſe, Sourdis</hi> and <hi>du Perron.</hi> And no Conſtable or Chancellor ever had that thought, except Monſieur <hi>de Sillery,</hi> who imparting his Ambition to the Conſtable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd him to aſpire to it.</p>
               <p>All the Ancients of the Council remember to have ſeen Monſieur <hi>de Guiſe</hi> ſeated above Monſieur <hi>de Sillery,</hi> and on the ſame ſide with him.</p>
               <p>The Queen remembers to have ſeen the Cardinal of <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> ſeated there, and formerly the Cardinal of <hi>Sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She alſo remembers he complain'd to her one day, that the Chancellor endeavudr'd to break up the Council to incroach that place.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:42519:266"/>
               <p>The Expedient propos'd by the ſaid Chancellor, was, That there ſhould be one Side of the Dignities, on which the Children of <hi>France,</hi> the Princes of the Blood, and other Princes, Dukes and Peers ſhould be ſeated conſecutively: And another Side of the Officers, on which the Conſtable, Chancellor, Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> and other Officers ſhould be plac'd.</p>
               <p>And foreſeeing that this would be look'd upon as a great Abſurdity, ſince by this Means, he would be ſeated ſometimes above the Children of <hi>France,</hi> Princes of the Blood, or Cardinals, he propos'd the making a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſetling the two Sides of Dignities, and of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould at the ſame time expreſs, that the Second Place on the Side of the Dignities ſhould be Nobler than the Firſt Place on the Side of the Officers.</p>
               <p>This Propoſition deſtroys it ſelf evidently, ſeeing that not only Kings, but even God himſelf, cannot make the Vale of a Hill to be the Top thereof; nor the Feet of a Man to be higher than his Head. So that, in reality, whatever Subtlity was us'd, the Chancellor had a mind to precede thoſe who in Reaſon have always preceded him; ſince the Second Perſon of the Right Side would not have been ſo nobly ſeated, as the Firſt on the Left.</p>
               <p>This Deſign was, openly to ſettle a perpetual Precedency in the King's Council, by the Chancellor, like unto that of the Firſt Preſident of the Parliament, who has a certain fix'd Seat, which he does not ſo much as yield to the Princes of the Blood. This would be of very ill Conſequence in the Council, for ſeveral Reaſons eaſily thought on.</p>
               <p>No body can be ignorant of the End of this Pretenſion, if they conſider that the Jealouſie of keeping this regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Place has often induced the Chancellor, His Majeſty being abſent from the Council, to give the King's own Place to qualify'd Perſons, (which was never done before,) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than quit his own.</p>
               <p>Therefore the King has wiſely condemn'd the ſaid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, as being very prejudicial; and given the Firſt Place of his Council, in which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſits when he is there, to the Cardinal <hi>de la Roch-foucaul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that the ſaid Prince coming, the ſaid Cardinal ſhould remove to the other Side, which is the Second Place. And thus the Chancellor was abſolutely depriv'd of the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he expected by this Propoſition; which is the ſame that is continu'd at preſent, contrary to the Judgment the King was pleas'd to give at that time.</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:42519:266"/>
               <p>Should any thing be alter'd about this Pretenſion at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it would be as unjuſt, whatever Retrenchments were made, as it was in the whole; ſince it is evident, by the Examples above-mention'd, that the Cardinals have never yielded to any but the Princes of the Blood, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aboveſaid, which can only be of force in relation to them; and conſequently, that, next to them, they ought to poſſeſs the firſt Places, and of Courſe theirs in their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>That the nobleſt Places have always been look'd upon to be thoſe that are the firſt on the two Sides, oppoſite to each other; and thus ſucceſſively, <hi>Du Tillet</hi> ſhews us by the following Words: <hi>The Difficulty is, when the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es are mix'd, and not by themſelves,</hi> viz. <hi>to the Left, or Right. The firſt Rank due to them, muſt be underſtood, next to the Queen and the Children of</hi> France, <hi>both Princes and Princeſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is moſt certain, that all the Members of the King's Council keep their Rank according to the Dignity by which they poſſeſs that Place. Since then Cardinals, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, precede thoſe who at this time diſpute the Precedence with them in the Council, undoubtly their Pretenſion is unjuſt.</p>
               <p>The Cardinals have always had a free Entrance into the King's Council, with the Rank due to their Dignity: And thoſe who are acquainted with Hiſtory, cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that it is not ſo with Chancellors, who have only been admitted there ſince a certain Time.</p>
               <p>None of the Chancellors before Monſieur <hi>de Sillery,</hi> were ever admitted to the Secret Council, or to that of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the <hi>Finances.</hi> And the Ancients of the Council know, and can teſtifie, that Meſſieurs <hi>de Chiverny</hi> and <hi>de Bellievre</hi> were not of the Council of the ſaid Affairs, nor of the <hi>Finances,</hi> unleſs when, on ſome extraordinary Occaſions, the late King ſent for them thither.</p>
               <p>To what End ſhould an Innovation be made in a moſt Chriſtian Kingdom, under a moſt Juſt, and moſt Pious King, contrary to what has already been adjudg'd. An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation to the prejudice of the Church, of which he is the Eldeſt Son and that only to ſatisfie the Paſſion of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſon.</p>
               <p>If the thing in queſtion were, to diſpute a Point, in which neither of the Parties contending had any Right, the Cardinals then ought to be preferr'd: How then can that be diſputed, which they are in poſſeſſion of; and they be depriv'd of that which belongs to them, to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42519:267"/>
give it to thoſe who have no Title to it, but their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion?</p>

               <p>THis Day, being the 9th of <hi>May,</hi> 1624. the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Compiegne,</hi> after having heard the Duke <hi>de l' Eſdiguieres,</hi> Peer and Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> in his Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances about the Seats in Council, againſt the Cardinals, his Majeſty was pleas'd to admit into the ſame; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Reaſons into ſerious Conſideration; His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was pleas'd to command him to yield that which he did pretend to, at the moſt earneſt Entreaty of the Queen, his Mother, on Condition that it ſhould not ſerve as a Preſident againſt him, or any of his Succeſſors in the Conſtableſhip; and that only to one of the ſaid Cardinals. Whereof His Majeſty (the Marquis <hi>de la Vieuville,</hi> Knight of his Order, and Superintendent of his Fiances, and <hi>du Hallier,</hi> alſo Knight of his ſaid Order, and Captain of his Guards, being preſent, and Witneſſes to theſe Preſents) has order'd this Act to be drawn by us, his Counſellors, Secretaries of State, and of his Commands, who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the whole Action.</p>

               <p>THE ſaid Mareſchals muſt know, that His Majeſty has written to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> that his Army, conſiſting of Five and Twenty Thouſand Foot, and Five
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42519:267"/>
Thouſand Horſe, and a ſuitable Train of Artillery, will repair to <hi>Rochefort</hi> on the 12th of <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſaid Mareſchals are to take a particular Care to cauſe all neceſſary Preparations to be made for the Paſſage of the King's Army, in order to join that of the States.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Mareſchals are to be at <hi>Meziers</hi> on the 28th of this Inſtant, to put all things in readineſs for their March, in order to be at the aforeſaid place on the 12th of <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majeſty allows the ſaid Mareſchals, in caſe they judge it more convenient and proper for his Service, to join the ſaid Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> by any other Way, provided it be by the Conſent of the ſaid Prince.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces ſhould oppoſe the Paſſage of the ſaid Mareſchals, ſo as to hinder their Conjunction with the ſaid Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> without coming to Action, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty permits them to combat the Enemy, if they think they can do it with Advantage, and great likelihood of Succeſs; unleſs they judge it more proper to encamp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Enemies, and to ſend the ſaid Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to advance on his ſide, in order to incloſe the Enemies between the two Armies.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty's Army being join'd with that of the ſaid States, the ſaid Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is to give the Word in both, by virtue of the Power given unto him by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
               <p>All the Reſolutions of the two Armies are to be conſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the ſaid Prince, and the ſaid Mareſchals only: And the ſaid Mareſchals are to ſummons to the particular Councils they ſhall hold for the Execution of the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd on with the ſaid Prince, all ſuch Perſons as uſe to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the ſame in the King's Armies.</p>
               <p>The two Armies being join'd, His Majeſty is of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the firſt thing to be done, is, to fight the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which is to be endeavour'd as much as poſſible.</p>
               <p>In caſe the Enemies ſhould put themſelves in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture by Encampment, as to ſecure themſelves from being forc'd to ſight, Endeavours muſt be us'd to ſtarve, and make them periſh that way, or elſe to force them in their Trenches, if the Maxims of War permit it.</p>
               <p>If any particular Conſiderations, as, the Abundance of the Enemies Proviſions, and the Diſſiculties of getting them for the two Armies in Conjunction, ſhould prevent ſuch a Deſign, His Majeſty's Opinion is, That the only Remedy would be, to march directly into the Heart of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, towards <hi>Bruſſels, Louvain, Malines,</hi> and ſuch other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42519:268"/>
as ſhall be thought fit by common Advice: And that for this Reaſon, That beſides the attacking the Enemies chief Cities, by this Means their Forces, being oblig'd to march to their Aſſiſtance, will hardly be able to avoid a Combat.</p>
               <p>If the Enemies, inſtead of keeping the Field, ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide their Forces into their beſt Gariſons, it is thought, that the beſt way would be to attack the Place into which the Cardinal-Infant ſhall retire; by reaſon that if he could be taken, the War would be at an end in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in caſe he ſhould retire into ſome Place belonging to his Neighbours and Allies, it will be neceſſary to follow him there, and, if poſſible, to force the Place into which he ſhall retire, if the thing be feaſible, and adviſable.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Mareſchals are alſo to take notice, That if it be needful to divide the 50000 Foot, and 10000 Horſe, which are to be in His Majeſty's and the States Armies, into ſeveral Bodies, the ſaid Diviſion muſt be made in ſuch a manner, that every ſuch Body may be compos'd with part of His Majeſty's, and part of the ſaid States Forces; to ſhew in all things the ſtrict Union there is between His Majeſty and the ſaid States.</p>
               <p>And in caſe, by the Taking of any Town, the Queen, His Majeſty's Mother, or the Princeſs <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſhould chance to fall into His Majeſty's and the ſaid States Hands, it is His Majeſty's Deſire, that the ſaid Queen, his Mother, be us'd with all the Honour and Reſpect due to her Quality; and that the Princeſs <hi>Margaret</hi> be kept in ſuch a manner, that they may be able to anſwer for her Perſon; treating her however with all the Civility requir'd towards a Perſon of her Birth. In ſuch a Caſe, the ſaid Mareſchals are to cauſe thoſe that ſhall be taken with the Queen, to be carefully ſecur'd; and are to know her Pleaſure, to acquaint His Hajeſty therewith; and in the mean time, are to take particular Care that ſhe may neither receive or execute any Reſolution, contrary to His Majeſty's Service.</p>
               <p>His ſaid Majeſty authorizes the ſaid Mareſchals to reſolve with the ſaid Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> all things not contradictory to the Treaty made with the ſaid States on the 8th of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> laſt paſt, or that are not contrary to the Article of the preſent Inſtruction, as they ſhall think it moſt proper for the common Good</p>

               <p>THE King ever did repoſe ſuch a Confidence in the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> that he gave him at the very firſt beginning of his Commiſſion, as he does ſtill at this time, full liberty and Power to do with his Army whatever he ſhall think fit for his Majeſty's Service.</p>
               <p>We have all along dreaded the ſudden changes to which our Hiſtory informs us, that the <hi>Germans</hi> have ſometimes been ſubject. Nothing can be more ſurprizing than that we find at this time in the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> and the four Millions that are demanded by the Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are willing to believe that conſiderations of Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, will hinder them from doing any thing that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the loſs of their Reputation, in contributing to the ruin of the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and the Army under his Command. Nevertheleſs, if the making an unreaſonable Treaty, like that of the four Millions demanded by the Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Weymar,</hi> be abſolutely neceſſary to hinder him from abandoning the King; his Majeſty impowers the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> to conclude it, and to ſign or cauſe the ſame to be ſign'd by Monſieur <hi>Feuquieres,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he ſhall think fit.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> will do well, firſt, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reduce the ſaid Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> to a reaſonable Treaty. The maintenance of Six Thouſand Horſe, at the rate of eight Muſters, which is much for Men that never had any, amounts at Ten Crowns a Man to Sixteen Hundred Thouſand Livers a Year.</p>
               <p>That of the Twelve Thouſand Foot at the ſame Rate of eight Muſters, amounts to no more.</p>
               <p>Therefore it ſeems, that if the King ſhould give Three Millions, for the maintenance of Six Thouſand Horſe, and Twelve Thouſand Foot, beſides what they will get by the Contributions in <hi>Germany,</hi> where they never had any other ſubſiſtance, they ſhould have a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ſatisfy'd.</p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:42519:269"/>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, if the time and preſent occaſions require more to be given to the ſaid Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Weymar,</hi> the King leaves it to the diſcretion of the Cardinal <hi>de la Valet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> as far as the four Millions demanded.</p>
               <p>It is alſo referr'd to the ſaid Cardinal to inſert in the Treaty he will make, or cauſe to be made with the ſaid Duke <hi>Bernard,</hi> the moſt advantageous Conditions he can for the King's Service.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, it is very reaſonable to Note, that he will be paid what ſhall be agreed upon, on condition that he ſhall always effectually keep on Foot, for the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the number of 6000 Horſe and 12000 Foot, which ſhall be juſtify'd by the Reviews that ſhall be made eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Muſter.</p>
               <p>If it be poſſible, it muſt alſo be agreed. that the ſaid Horſe and Foot ſhall keep the Field, the Forces that are in Garriſon living commonly on Contributions, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Garriſon, and of their Neighbourhood, that in caſe the King gives his Money, he may be certain of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Army on Foot, capable to oppoſe his Ememies.</p>
               <p>In fine, the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> is to get the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions he can for the King's Service, though none be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd to him, the King leaving him a full Liberty to conclude the Treaty, as he ſhall think moſt fitting, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diminiſhing whatever he ſhall judge proper.</p>
               <p>Though we do not think, that the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> or Duke <hi>Weymar,</hi> would be guilty of an Infidelity; yet we cannot forbear conſidering and dreading the condition and place, in which the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> is, as well for the King's Intereſt, as for the Affection he has for his Perſon.</p>
               <p>Therefore we conclude, like him, that the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous method he can follow at preſent, if the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of <hi>Heſſe</hi> and Duke <hi>Weymar</hi> will reſolve to Fight, will be to chuſe a proper time and place ſo to do, with all the Circumſpections imaginable.</p>
               <p>Or, in caſe he ſhould find, that whatever Negotiation and Treaty he could make with them, he could not rely on their ſtedfaſtneſs, it will be prudent for him to conſider all means that may enble him, according as he ſhall think it moſt proper to retire to a place, where their inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may not put him in danger of an abſolute Ruin; as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Metz,</hi> under pretence of ſcarcity of Proviſions, or of putting the Army into Winter Quarters.</p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:42519:269"/>
               <p>Though this Advice be given to him, it is not that he is thought to be reduc'd to ſuch a Misfortune; but in point of prudence it is neceſſary to fore-caſt all the remedies that can be thought of in ſuch Extremities, tho' only to make uſe of them in the utmoſt Emergencies.</p>
               <p>In the Name of God, give Us a ſpeedy account of your Condition, to put us out of Trouble. In the mean time an Army will be kept in <hi>Champagne,</hi> where the King will be in Perſon, to advance towards <hi>Mets,</hi> if you ſtand in need of it: But it will be neceſſary for you to let us have timely notice of it, by reaſon that if the ſaid Army be not wanted there, it may be ſent elſewhere.</p>
               <p>I had forgot to tell you, what may be done to fix the Landgrave, and to ingage him not to leave the King.</p>
               <p>I am of Opinion that you might Treat a new with him, promiſing him, that the King will never make a Peace, without including, not only his Perſon, and his ancient Territories in the Treaty, but alſo his new Conqueſts, or an equivalent for the ſame to his ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Matters may alſo be order'd in ſuch a manner, that the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> may ingage, to ſuccor the Landgrave, with the Forces the King is to maintain for him, in caſe of need, on condition that the ſaid Landgrave ſhall alſo aſſiſt the King's ſaid Forces, and the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> in the late caſe,</p>
               <p>One might alſo give the ſaid Landgrave ſome part of the Army, which the King impowers you to give to the Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Weymar,</hi> making the ſaid Duke ſenſible, that though he would get ſomewhat the leſs by it, yet he would derive a far greater advantage by the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he would have with the ſaid Landgrave.</p>
               <p>We are much at a loſs how to divide the Honour of the Command between them.</p>
               <p>Yet I fancy, that if you could make them agree about the ſharing of the Army, which the King is to imploy in <hi>Germany,</hi> you might do the ſame about the Command, as followeth.</p>
               <p>That the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> ſhould Command the Forces he is to have, as General of the Troops granted to the Confederacy.</p>
               <p>And the Landgrave thoſe that the King ſhould furniſh him, by virtue of the Command he has from the King.</p>
               <p>I am perſuaded that your Addreſs, your good Fortune and your Wit, will furniſh you with expedients againſt all our Evils in your parts.</p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:42519:270"/>
               <p>You may treat of the things above mention'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
               <p>If the War ſhould chance to laſt, and conqueſts be made, the King promiſes ſuch a ſhare thereof to the ſaid Landgrave, as he ſhall deſire.</p>
               <p>At the very inſtant this Courier is diſpatching to you, another is going for <hi>Flanders,</hi> to endeavour to diſpoſe the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to permit Two Thouſand Horſe of the King's Army, and Two Thouſand Muſqueteers mounted on Nags, to march from thence to joyn the Forces under your Command.</p>
               <p>I am of Opinion that it will be fit for you at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of this, to ſend ſome body to the Marſhal <hi>de Breze,</hi> to acquaint him with the Places through which it will be moſt convenient for them to march.</p>

               <p>THE King repoſes ſo much Confidence in the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and affection of the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and His Majeſty has receiv'd ſuch real proofs thereof, ſince his having giving him the Command of his Army in <hi>Germany,</hi> that he does not only approve the reaſons which have made him take the Reſolution of paſſing the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but moreover gives him full power, hereafter to form ſuch other deſigns and reſolutions as he ſhall find upon the place, to be moſt advantageous for his Majeſty's Service, and for the Reputation of his Arms, being perſuaded that he will not Engage them without reaſon, and that he will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take nothing without hopes of a good Succeſs.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty ſends this Courier to the ſaid Cardinal, to acquaint him that, finding by his laſt diſpatch, as well as by that of the Sieur <hi>de Feuquiere,</hi> the demand of Four Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Livers, made by the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> to fix him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the King's Service, (unleſs he had a great deal of confidence in the ſaid Duke's Sincerity,) he ſhould have reaſon to believe, that he makes this exceſſive demand, either for a pretence to break with him at this very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, if refus'd, or at leaſt to have one to quit his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Intereſt at ſome time or other, in caſe the payment of the ſaid Summ ſhould not be perform'd.</p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:42519:270"/>
               <p>Though by this Means His Majeſty, inſtead of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Aſſiſtance from the Forces of his Confederates, finds himſelf reduc'd to bear the whole Burthen of them, and to maintain them at his own Charges; which is very difficult for him to do at this time, conſidering the great number of other Expences he is at in <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aly,</hi> the <hi>Griſons, Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Picardy;</hi> yet he thinks it ſo neceſſary, for the Good of his Service, to keep the ſaid Duke ſtedfaſt to his Intereſt, and ſo dangerous to loſe him, that he is of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that nothing ſhould be omitted in order to fix him in ſuch a manner, that there may be no Reaſon to fear his falling off for the future.</p>
               <p>To this End, His Majeſty impowers the ſaid Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> to offer as far as Three Millions Two Hundred Thouſand Livres, which is about the Payment of Eight Muſters for Six Thouſand Horſe and Twelve Thouſand Foot, in caſe he finds that he cannot come off at an eaſier Rate, and that keeping him within the Bounds of a ſmaller Summ, might induce the ſaid Duke to engage in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Party.</p>
               <p>It will ſuit with the ſaid Cardinal's Prudence, to huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band His Majeſty's Intereſt in this Occaſion, which is of great Moment, as advantageouſly as poſſibly can be, and to yield only by degrees; repreſenting to the ſaid Duke, that it is much at this time to give him double the Summ that was formerly given to the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which is that as has already been offer'd to him by Monſieur <hi>de Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieres.</hi> After that, he is to offer him ſomething more, if Two Millions of Livres are not capable to content him. In fine, he may go as far as Three Millions Two Hundred Thouſand Livres, if, as aboveſaid, he finds the Refuſal of the ſaid Duke's entire Pretentions capable to drive him to an extream Reſolution, contrary to his Honour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Summ being ſufficient for the Payment of eight entire Muſters for Six Thouſand Horſe and Twelve Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, which is what is expended in the beſt paid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> if the ſaid Duke ſhould make a Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of being ſatisfy'd therewith, there would be great Reaſon to believe, that he ſeeks Pretences to quit His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Intereſt; and that in that Caſe, whatever Promiſes were made to him, would be vain; ſeeing that, in order to effect his Deſires, he would raiſe his Pretenſions <hi>ad infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,</hi> and would never be ſatisfy'd.</p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:42519:271"/>
               <p>In ſuch an Extremity, evidently known by the ſaid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal; which the King, nevertheleſs, is unwilling to fear, of a Prince who hitherto has acquir'd a great deal of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and makes a ſtrict Profeſſion of it; the ſaid Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de la Valette</hi> is to uſe his beſt Endeavours to ſecure the King's Army, and to free it from thoſe Dangers to which it would be expos'd, ſhould the ſaid Duke change Sides. This is only hinted, not to omit any thing that might happen, or the proper Remedies to be apply'd in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
               <p>In caſe he will be ſatisfy'd with the ſaid Summ of Three Millions Two Hundred Thouſand Livres, or can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to take leſs, which muſt be endeavour'd as much as can be, the following Conditions muſt be agreed on at the ſame time, if poſſible.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Six or Seven Hundred Thouſand Livres ſhall be given out of the ſaid Summ, to the Landtgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> for the Maintenance of his Forces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Form of the Command between the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> and the Landtgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd, both being join'd, or aſunder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That both of them, in conſideration of the Summs paid unto them, ſhall command their Armies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King's Authority; <hi>viz.</hi> the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> as General of the Forces of the Confederacy; and the Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> as General of the <hi>German</hi> Forces, maintain'd at the King's Charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That neither of them ſhall be allow'd to quit the King's Intereſt, or to hearken to any Propoſitions of Peace or Accommodation, whether general or particular, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out His Majeſty's Approbation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That in caſe the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> ſhould not have the ſaid Number of Six Thouſand Horſe and Twelve Thouſand Foot actually into the Field, the Review where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to be made at His Majeſty's Pleaſure, and as often as he ſhall think fit, it ſhall be lawful to ſtop as much out of the ſaid promis'd Summ, as ſhall anſwer the Failure of the ſaid Number.</p>
               <p>It muſt alſo be requir'd, ſince the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives His Majeſty's Pay, that he ſhould oblige himſelf to follow and execute ſuch Orders as ſhall be ſent him by His Majeſty, to the Prejudice and Excluſion of all others
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42519:271"/>
that might be given him to the contrary. Nevertheleſs, if he ſhould ſeem too averſe to it, the King will be ſatisfy'd with being ſecur'd, that whatever ill Event his Affairs might have in <hi>Germany,</hi> he will remain ſteady to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Intereſt and Service, upon the King's Promiſe that he will never make a Peace, without his being included in it; and to fulfil all the Articles of the Treaty that will be made with him, according to his preceding Memoirs, which are to be follow'd in every Point not compris'd in this.</p>
               <p>After the ſending of this Memoir, His Majeſty has thought fit ſtill to leave the ſaid Cardinal the Liberty to promiſe as far as the Four Millions of Livres, in caſe he thinks it impoſſible to keep the ſaid Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to His Majeſty's Intereſt without it.</p>
               <p>This Condition is ſo unreaſonable, and the Summ ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, that the ſaid Cardinal is not to oblige himſelf to it, till the laſt Extremity; and to avoid thoſe Evils he may foreſee will enſue, in caſe he ſhould not comply.</p>

                  <hi>Inſtructions for the Cardinal</hi> de la Valette.</head>
               <p>THE King being ſenſible that there is nothing ſo preſſing and important at this time, for his Service, as the Furniſhing of the Gariſons of <hi>Alſatia</hi> ſpeedily with Proviſions, His Majeſty has already ſent two Couriers to the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and to the Marquis <hi>de la Force,</hi> to that effect; his Deſire that no Time may be loſt for the Performance of that Enterpriſe, obliges him to diſpatch this third Meſſenger.</p>
               <p>His ſaid Majeſty therefore judges it neceſſary, forthwith to prepare the ſaid Proviſions, the Carriages for their Tranſportation, Men to convoy the ſame, and the Money for the Muſters that are due to the Gariſons of <hi>Colmar, Schleſtadt</hi> and <hi>Haguenau.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two Thouſand Rations of Wheat muſt be ſent, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Monſieur <hi>Gangnot,</hi> who went from hence yeſterday, has aſſur'd His Majeſty, that he had the ſaid Quantity in readineſs, and that he would order the Delivery of it to the Perſon appointed for the carrying thereof; he will be upon the Spot, to execute the Orders he has receiv'd: And leſt he ſhould meet with any Obſtacles in an Undertaking of that Conſequence, Six Thouſand Livres have been put
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42519:272"/>
into his hands, to be employ'd for the Sacking and Lading of the ſaid Corn, and other neceſſary Charges.</p>
               <p>The greateſt Impediment in this Buſineſs will be, about the Carriage-Horſes, ſince we are inform'd, that in this Seaſon Waggons cannot go through thoſe places that are ſtill open to go to <hi>Colmar;</hi> ſo that the ſaid Wheat muſt of neceſſity be carry'd on the Backs of the ſaid Horſes. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are already ſent, to employ all the Horſes belonging to the Artillery and Proviſions of the two Armies of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain;</hi> to borrow as many from the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> as he can furniſh; to hire Two Hundred from Colonel <hi>Gaſſion,</hi> who has promis'd to provide them, in order to carry at leaſt Two Thouſand Rations, at any rate whatſoever.</p>
               <p>In caſe of a Diſappointment of thoſe Horſes which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Gaſſion</hi> has promis'd, and thoſe that Duke <hi>Bernard</hi> is able to furniſh, His Majeſty is willing that the Sieur <hi>de Villarſeaux</hi> ſhould employ all thoſe that are under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for that Service, though they were prepar'd for Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages into the Country.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty reckons, according to the Information he has receiv'd, that 3000 Horſes, and 3000 Muſquetiers, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of all the Forces, will ſuffiſe for the ſaid Convoy; and that, in order thereunto, 1200 effective Muſquetiers muſt be taken out of the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi>'s Army; 500 Foreign Horſes, and 150 <hi>French,</hi> drawn either out of divers Companies, or otherwiſe, as ſhall be thought moſt convenient</p>
               <p>Out of the Marquis <hi>de la Force</hi>'s Army, 800 Muſquetiers, 800 Foreign Horſes, and 100 <hi>French,</hi> in the ſame Form as out of the Cardinal's.</p>
               <p>That 1200 Horſes ſhall be taken from Duke <hi>Bernard;</hi> and that 1000 Muſquetiers and 250 <hi>French</hi> Horſe ſhall be drawn out of the Army in <hi>Champaign,</hi> which ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Forces given to the Sieur <hi>de Vaubecourt,</hi> out of the Regiments of the <hi>Marine</hi> and <hi>Vernancourt,</hi> which ſhall be order'd to march towards <hi>Nancy,</hi> there to receive the ſaid Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi>'s Orders.</p>
               <p>All neceſſary Orders are ſending to the Count of — to Duke <hi>Bernard,</hi> and to the Marquis <hi>de la Force,</hi> for the Preparation and March of the Forces that are to be drawn out of the Armies under their Command.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Cardinal muſt not forget to diſtribute to the ſaid Troops as much Proviſion at their Departure, as they can carry for their Journey. Their March not exceeding four Days, from their Rendeſvouz-General to <hi>Colmar,</hi> they may
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42519:272"/>
carry a ſufficient quantity for their Journey going; and take as much out of <hi>Colmar,</hi> as will be neceſſary for their Return; ſending notice beforehand to the Inhabitants, to provide a ſufficient quantity for them; which will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd them out of the Wheat carry'd into the ſaid Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
               <p>A particular Care muſt be taken of the Beaſts of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and Orders given for their carrying of Oats along with them, and, if poſſible, ſome Hay, to ſeed them until they are paſt the Mountains of <hi>Alſatia;</hi> which being paſt, <hi>Manicamp</hi> aſſures us, that they will find Proviſions and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in abundance; but it is to be fear'd that they will find nothing on this ſide the Mountains.</p>
               <p>A Clerk of the Treaſury has been ſent Poſt with the 6 and 7 Muſters due to the Gariſons of <hi>Alſatia:</hi> The ſaid Cardinal is to take care to ſee the ſame deliver'd to them, even to the Troops of Horſe that are there, in caſe he thinks they are in want of it for their Subſiſtence.</p>
               <p>He is alſo, during his Journey, to endeavour to get ſome certain notice of the true State <hi>Haguenan</hi> is in at this time, that in caſe there be any poſſibility to relieve the ſame, it may be done.</p>
               <p>After having put Proviſions into <hi>Colmar</hi> and <hi>Schleſtadt,</hi> the ſaid Cardinal is to leave ſuch a number of Foreign Horſe in each of them, as he ſhall think fit to keep the Enemies at a diſtance from them; and to ſend to <hi>Montbeliard,</hi> to the Count <hi>de la Suze,</hi> ſuch Forces as he ſhall ſtand in need of. The Regiments of <hi>Layn, Harf</hi> and <hi>Forbus</hi> ſeem to be the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for that Service: All the Means that can be, muſt be us'd for their Subſiſtence there; and they muſt be re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd, if poſſible, during their Stay there.</p>
               <p>As this Diſpatch was going to be clos'd, His Majeſty has receiv'd ſome Intelligence from <hi>Manicamp,</hi> an Abſtract of which he ſends to the ſaid Cardinal, that he may regulate himſelf accordingly: Nevertheleſs, though he repreſents the thing to be very eaſie; it is His Majeſty's Pleaſure, that a ſtrong Body be ſent, in order to effect the Matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger. If after the Execution thereof, the ſaid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal finds Conveniencies beyond the Mountains to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Forces there, either by Convoys, or by the Means of <hi>Baſle,</hi> His Majeſty thinks fit to leave ſome there; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, a greater Number of Foreign Horſe. And if the Fear of not finding a ſufficient quantity of Proviſions on his March, for ſo great a Number, ſhould hinder him from taking all the Foreign Regiments along with him, it wil
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42519:273"/>
be neceſſary, at leaſt, to ſend them out in Parties, while he advances that way, to make a Diverſion, and to create Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies in the Enemies, another Way.</p>

               <p>HIS Majeſty receiv'd divers Informations heretofore, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſome deſign upon <hi>Cazal;</hi> but he could hardly have been perſuaded, that it was with the Participation of the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua;</hi> whoſe intereſt was ſo conſiderable in <hi>France,</hi> that there was reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that though her heart was not well inclin'd for the King's Service, at leaſt ſhe ought to have diſſembled it, to oblige His Majeſty to be favourable to her, and to the Duke her Son in their Affairs.</p>
               <p>Though this Princeſs's ill deſigns are ſufficiently juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by the Depoſitions of <hi>Gajis</hi> and <hi>Monteils,</hi> which the ſaid Ambaſſador has taken very opportunely; his Majeſty is nevertheleſs of Opinion, that it is not fit as yet to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them ſuch as they are, nor to ſhew his Reſentment againſt her; becauſe His Majeſty is able to do his Buſineſs without it, and that it is neceſſary before, if poſſible, to induce the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> to ſecure <hi>Mantua,</hi> as he has done <hi>Gazal.</hi> His Majeſty commends the care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence us'd by the ſaid Cardinal and his Ambaſſador in that affair, and deſires them to continue their ſaid care in keeping a ſtrickt Eye over the ſaid City, the conſequence whereof is ſufficiently known to them. They are to take care above all things, no longer to ſuffer any ſuſpected Perſons to tarry there. And beſides their particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, they are to confer about it with Chancellor <hi>Guiſcardi,</hi> who will be mention'd in the Sequel of this Memoir.</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:42519:273"/>
               <p>Although His Majeſty does not think it convenient at this time to accuſe the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi> of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Treaſon hatch'd in <hi>Cazal,</hi> againſt his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Service, to introduce the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there; yet His Msjeſty is of Opinion, that it ought to be publiſh'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naming the ſaid Princeſs, pretending that the Forces introduc'd by her into the ſaid City in order to ſeize upon it, where only ſent to protect the young Duke againſt the pernicious deſigns of his Subjects, who have been gain'd by the Artifices of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majeſty highly approves the ſeizing of <hi>Monteils</hi> by an Ordinance of the Senate of <hi>Cazal;</hi> this proceeding abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely juſtifying His Majeſty's Actions. His Majeſty's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is to have the ſaid <hi>Monteils</hi> brought to his Tryal; and to that end he has ſent two Commiſſions, the one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Sieur <hi>d' Argenſon,</hi> and to the ſaid Senate of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal,</hi> and the other to the Counſel of War, in order that the ſaid Cardinal and the ſaid Ambaſſador may uſe that which they think moſt proper. In which it is neceſſary to uſe a great deal of Prudence, not to truſt the Senate of <hi>Cazal</hi> with the Tryal of <hi>Monteils,</hi> unleſs they find their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be ſuch as are agreeable with the Wellfare of their Country, and the King's Service. And whereas it will be a thing very well receiv'd throughout <hi>Italy,</hi> if <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nteils</hi> be condemn'd by the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s own Judges; ſo it would redound very much to the King's Reputation if the wickedneſs of that man were juſtify'd, by reaſon that what has been done lately at <hi>Cazal,</hi> is grounded upon that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. After theſe Conſiderations, his Majeſty referrs this Affair to the Prudence of the ſaid Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> and Monſieur <hi>d' Hemery,</hi> being ſatisfy'd that they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to manage it in ſuch a manner that his Majeſty will receive no prejudice by it.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary, not only to get a particular account of <hi>Monteils</hi> deſigns, but alſo to diſcover all his accomplices, and to ſecure them: The ſaid Cardinal and the ſaid Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador are likewiſe to uſe their beſt endeavours to get the moſt Authentick proofs that can be had, of the ſhare the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi> has had in this deteſtable Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; but without ſaying any thing about it, only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able his Majeſty to make uſe of it, at a proper time for the wellfare of his Affairs.</p>
               <p>The King writes to <hi>Guiſcardi,</hi> Count <hi>Mercurin</hi> and <hi>Prat,</hi> to expreſs his gratitude to them for their proceeding in the ſaid Affair; he is reſolv'd to reward them, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42519:274"/>
the ſervices they have done on that occaſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Majeſty deſires the ſaid Cardinal, and the ſaid Ambaſſador, to let him know ſpeedily what they think he ought to do for them, which ſhall be perform'd in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

In fine, they are to give thoſe three Perſons all the Demonſtrations of affection imaginable from his Majeſty. They are to do the ſame to <hi>Porre,</hi> and to the Mayor of the City, and to acquaint his Majeſty what rewards they think fit for them.</p>
               <p>The King conſents to receive <hi>Gajis</hi> into ſome City in the middle of his Kingdom, to make him Sergeant Major there, and to allow him a perpetual Penſion of Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Livers, upon a particular receipt of the <hi>Tailles;</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto, Letters Patent ſhall be expedited for him, the Preamble whereof ſhall be, <hi>for having ſecur'd</hi> Cazal <hi>from Treaſon.</hi> The ſaid Cardinal and the ſaid Sieur <hi>d' He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi> are to ſend him away, as ſoon as he ſhall deſire it, and are to give him a thouſand Crowns for his Journey, out of the money which is due from <hi>Breſme,</hi> which ſhall be reimplac'd if neceſſary.</p>
               <p>As to what relates to the Garriſon and Fortifications of <hi>Cazal,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Noyers,</hi> has taken upon him, not only to get the Bill of Exchange of 30000 Livers accepted, but alſo to provide for all other things that are neceſſary. The ſaid Ambaſſador, in order to juſtify his Majeſty's Actions, is to give a particular account from himſelf, of all the Tranſactions at <hi>Cazal,</hi> to the Marſhal <hi>d' Eſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, du Houſſay, de la Thuillerie</hi> and <hi>la Tour,</hi> becauſe his Majeſty referrs all to him.</p>
               <p>The King having Examin'd the propoſitions made by the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> about the renewing the Treaty of the Offenſive and Defenſive League, ſends a project of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42519:274"/>
Treaty with the Preamble to the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> and the ſaid Sieur <hi>d' Emery,</hi> ſuch as they themſelves have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd reaſonable, and Authoriſes them to paſs it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. This they are to apply themſelves to, to ſettle the Dutcheſs's mind, which otherwiſe might be agitated by the divers propoſitions that are daily made to her.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and <hi>Emery</hi> are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, not to give the ſaid Dutcheſs the Title of Royal Highneſs in the Treaty, becauſe His Majeſty is reſolv'd not to alter his wonted manner of treating with the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> This they are to acquaint the ſaid Dutcheſs with in a very civil manner, aſſuring her that if the King does not do every thing according to her deſire, it is only becauſe time and occaſions are not fit for it, ſince he has all the affection for her ſhe can deſire.</p>
               <p>The Article which relates to the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> is worded in ſuch a manner, That the King does not oblige himſelf to include her into the Treaty; which point, it is not likely the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> will inſiſt upon, by reaſon of the ſentiments which we may ſuppoſe ſhe is in at this time. But in caſe ſhe ſhould do it, it might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of her to include the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> into the League, ſince the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> has promis'd to do it by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rivole;</hi> and thus her deſire in this point may be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>The King Orders the ſaid Cardinal and <hi>Emery,</hi> to take care not to ingage His Majeſty into new Expences, for the 3000. Foot and 1200 Horſe he is to maintain for the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and in order thereunto, they are to uſe their endeavours to get the 5th. Article paſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Note in the Nargin. But in caſe the ſaid Dutcheſs ſhould inſiſt upon the Effective payment of the intire Summ of 840000 Livers, they are to conſent to it, telling her that the King makes that Effort out of reſpect to her only.</p>
               <p>As to what relates to the 6th.

                  <hi>An important and ſecret Memoire ſent from the King to Marſhal</hi> Chaſtillon.</head>
               <p>WHEN Monſieur <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> was forc'd to raiſe the Siege of St. <hi>Omers,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de la Force</hi> and he ſent the Sieur <hi>Pagan</hi> to the King, to acquaint him that it was abſolutely neceſſary to raiſe the ſaid Siege, and that they were both of Opinion, at their removal from thence to beſiege <hi>Heſdin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King according to this Advice ſent them word, that ſince they could do no better, he did adhere to their Propoſition; and in order to enable them the better to put it in Execution, he reſolv'd to advance as far as <hi>Amiens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saligny</hi> came to the King at <hi>Amiens,</hi> ſent by thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to acquaint his Majeſty that they were ſtill of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it was fit to beſiege ſome place, but only, they were in doubt whither it ſhould be <hi>Hesdin</hi> or <hi>Arras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majeſty's Opinion was that <hi>Arras</hi> requir'd too large a Circumvallation for the return of an Army, and that there was too much difficulty to carry Proviſions thither; and thus the Attack of <hi>Heſdin,</hi> was reſolv'd upon.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:42519:275"/>
               <p>The Queſtion is now, What is moſt proper to be done; equally weighing the Conſiderations which may induce to do ſomething, and thoſe that may hinder it; as well as the preſent State of His Majeſty's Forces.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty's Reputation requires, that the Misfortu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Deſire of a Peace, which cannot be expected, unleſs our Affairs are ſucceſsful, is an abſolute Obligation to do it; as well as His Majeſty's Engagement with his Allies, who expect ſome conſiderable Performance from him, in order to enable them to do the ſame. This is ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that in caſe neither of them ſhould do any thing, one of theſe things will infallibly happen; either we ſhall never have a general Peace; or ſome of our Allies making theirs ſeparately. <hi>France</hi> will be involv'd in an eternal War, with all the Diſadvantages that can be expected of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that will be oblig'd alone to ſuſtain all the Efforts of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> that is, of all <hi>Germany, Spain, Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To avoid theſe Inconveniencies, it is neceſſary to reſolve what is to be done; taking as much Care not to engage in a Deſign manifeſtly impoſſible, as not to undertake thoſe that are poſſible, becauſe they are difficult.</p>
               <p>Meſſieurs <hi>de la Force</hi> and <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi>'s Armies muſt not be reckon'd to conſiſt of upwards of 22000 Men, for fear of being deceived.</p>
               <p>The Mareſchal <hi>de Breze</hi>'s, of 8000.</p>
               <p>The King, including the Body commanded by <hi>St. Prcuil,</hi> may have about 4000 Men, Horſe and Foot.</p>
               <p>We are raiſing about 10000 Men for Recruits, which are not to be depended upon for upwards of 6000.</p>
               <p>We have abundance of Warlike Ammunitions, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and of all things neceſſary for a great Deſign.</p>
               <p>The Enemies having put Men into ſeveral Gariſons, as it is repreſented, cannot have upwards of 15000 Men in the Field.</p>
               <p>The King deſires the Generals of his Armies, without ſhewing this Memoir to any body, under pain of Treaſon, to ſend him their Opinion ſpeedily in Writing, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom thereof.</p>

               </head>
               <p>SInce His Majeſty, by the Advice of His Eminency, is reſolv'd to employ the remainder of this Campaign on ſome Deſign that may maintain his Credit with his Allies, and be advantageous for his own Affairs; as it is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able not to propoſe any thing, the Succeſs of which may be uncertain, and bordering upon Impoſſibility, as well as not to ſtop upon Difficulties, which might hinder the undertaking of ſome Deſign worthy of the Reputation of his Arms.</p>
               <p>I find that the Opinion of the King's Council, as well as ours, fixes upon <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſden,</hi> which ſeems at preſent to be the only important Place proper to beſiege, by reaſon of the Conveniency for the Subſiſtence of the Army there; the Convoys for the Proviſions and Warlike Ammunitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſmall diſtance from each other, without the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being able to obſtruct them in the leaſt; conſidering alſo that the quantity of Cannons, Powder and Bullets lies ready, almoſt upon the very Spot, and adjacent Frontier-Towns; which is a great Advantage for that Undertaking, beſides our being favour'd by the Woods and the River, great Conveniences for a Seige.</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo conſider what is againſt us. The Place in queſtion is incomparably well fortify'd; provided with Ordnance, and all manner of Warlike Ammunitions; and a Gariſon conſiſting of 2500 Men, choſen out of the beſt Forces of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I am of Opinion, that this Siege cannot be undertaken with leſs than 15000 effective Foot, and all the Horſe in Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi>'s Army, and that under my Command.</p>
               <p>The Body commanded by <hi>St. Preuil,</hi> and that which is with the King, joining the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi>'s Men and mine, will ſupply the Loſs of Men we have ſuſtain'd, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Sickneſs, or Deſerters, which have weaken'd us ſince we remov'd from <hi>St. Omers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> will acquaint His Majeſty by Word of Mouth, with the Number of Men, both Horſe and Foot, under our Command.</p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:42519:276"/>
               <p>By this means the Mareſchal <hi>de Breze</hi>'s Army will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main free, to ſuccour thoſe that ſhall ſtand moſt in need of it, according to the Reſolution which the Commanders of the Enemies Armies may take, when they find us engag'd in a long Siege.</p>
               <p>In caſe they come up directly to us, when the new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they expect are join'd with them, the Body of Men commanded by Mareſchal <hi>de Breze,</hi> not being far from us, joining our Army in caſe of need, we ſhall be able to maintain the Siege againſt all the Forces that can fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; and to guard the Frontier of <hi>Picardy,</hi> as far as it extends, from <hi>Calais</hi> to <hi>Peronne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the Enemies ſhould attempt a Diverſion at a greater diſtance, drawing towards <hi>Guiſe,</hi> or father towards the Frontier of <hi>Champagne,</hi> I am of Opinion, that it will be neceſſary to detach an Army ſufficiently conſiderable to oppoſe the Deſigns of the Enemies.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a Caſe, a Detachment might be made of half the Horſe of the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi>'s Army, as well as of that under my Command, to join with the Mareſchal <hi>de Brez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>;</hi> which, together with his Foot, may compoſe an Army conſiderable enough to obſerve the Enemies Motions along the Frontier, being favour'd by the chief Towns, which will eaſily furniſh him with all things neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Thus the General who ſhall command that Army, may eaſily hinder the Enemies from forming any conſiderable Siege; or from entring into <hi>Champagne,</hi> to make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Spoil there.</p>
               <p>Some Regiments of Foot, that have been ſent under the Conduct of Monſieur <hi>de Bellefonds,</hi> may re-inforce the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my going into thoſe Parts.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to me, by this means, that all things may be provided for, and the Siege propos'd, carry'd on: In which, after the Circumvallation is made, 12000 Foot and 2000 Horſe effective muſt be employ'd, and encamp'd within our Lines and Quarters.</p>
               <p>We muſt make two different Approaches, the Guard of each conſiſting of 1500 Men, conſidering the Force of the Gariſon.</p>
               <p>We daily find our Armies weaken'd by Diſtempers; therefore we muſt be ſure of the Arrival of the 6000 effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Men, of the Recruits, by the 15th or 20th of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> to maintain the Army, and keep it in the Field until the middle of <hi>November;</hi> this Siege being likely to employ us till then.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:42519:277"/>
               <p>Provided this be done, I am of Opinion, that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign may be undertaken.</p>
               <p>If His Majeſty does me the Honour to employ me alone it, or with ſuch a Collegue as he ſhall think fit to chuſe, I will uſe my utmoſt Care, Induſtry and Pains, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it.</p>
               <p>But as to anſwer for the Events which may happen by Accidents unforeſeen, I do not think that any General, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the leaſt Experience, would undertake to command on ſuch Conditions.</p>
               <p>The King, who is very skilful in our Trade; and His Eminency, who is very clear-ſighted in all things, will eaſily reſolve, with the Advice of thoſe that are about His Majeſty, upon what is ſit to be undertaken, without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Time; and I will always boldly and faithfully execute whatever I am commanded.</p>

                  <hi>Inſtructions for the Baron d'</hi> Oyſonville.</head>
               <p>THE King having receiv'd Notice of the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi>'s Death, and being deſirous to provide for all things relating to his Service, and the Advantage of the common Cauſe, upon an Accident ſo unexpected, and of ſuch Conſequence, His Majeſty has thought fit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch unto Count <hi>Guebriant,</hi> Mareſchal of his Camps and Armies, commanding his Forces under the ſaid Duke's Command, a truſty Perſon, well inſtructed with his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this Subject; and to that end, he has choſen the Baron <hi>d'Oyſonville,</hi> Captain of a Troop of <hi>Chevaux Leyers,</hi> in his Sereice.</p>
               <p>The ſaid <hi>Oyſonville</hi> is to repair with all ſpeed to the ſaid Count <hi>Guebriant;</hi> and is to know, that the chief End of his Journey, is, to fix and ſecure thoſe Forces into His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Service, which were commanded by the ſaid Duke of <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As to what relates to the Forces, I am willing that the ſaid <hi>Guebriant</hi> and <hi>Oyſonville</hi> ſhould offer to all the Colonels, both of Horſe and Foot, the ſame Treatment they did receive from the aforeſaid Duke of <hi>Weymar;</hi> and moreover, a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of 6000 Livres apiece.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:42519:277"/>
               <p>And to make them the more ſenſible that His Majeſty is deſirous to keep them for ever in his Service, his Goodneſs is ſuch, that he is willing to ſecure them Revenues in <hi>France</hi> upon his Demeſnes, for ever.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty does not particularly preſcribe to the ſaid Count <hi>Guebriant,</hi> what Revenue he is willing to give upon his Demeſne, to each of the ſaid Colonels, becauſe it is fit for him and the ſaid Baron <hi>d'Oyſonville</hi> to diſcover their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, and the Capacity of each of them; there being ſome who deſerve more than others. His Majeſty is of Opinion, that the Counts of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> and <hi>Ohems,</hi> as alſo Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Scheumbee,</hi> will deſerve 12000 Livres a Year upon his Demeſne apiece: and that the reſt may be allow'd, ſome ſix, ſome 8000 Livres Revenue, more or leſs, according as the ſaid Count and Baron ſhall think fit upon the place.</p>
               <p>After having agreed with the ſaid Colonels, about the Conditions on which they are to remain in His Majeſty's Service, at the time they are paid, an Oath muſt be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter'd to them, to ſerve His Majeſty well and faithfully, towards and againſt all.</p>
               <p>As to the Sieur <hi>d'Erlach,</hi> when he was here, he declar'd openly to Meſſieurs <hi>de Bullion, Chavigny</hi> and <hi>de Noyers,</hi> that in caſe the ſaid Duke ſhould be taken off, he would rather die, than fail to keep his Government for His Majeſty's Service. Moreover, the Anſwer the ſaid Duke made to the Articles ſent to the ſaid Count <hi>Guebriant,</hi> after the Negotiation made by the ſaid <hi>Erlach,</hi> with His Majeſty, in the ſaid Duke's Name, ſays in expreſs Terms, ſpeaking of <hi>Briſac,</hi> and the other Gariſons kept by the ſaid Duke, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: <hi>In caſe of His Highneſs's Death or Impriſonment, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures His Majeſty, that he will order Matters ſo, and take ſuch Care of the aforeſaid Places, that his Succeſſors, or Commanders, ſhall give His Majeſty the ſame Satisfaction he can expect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and does actually receive from His Highneſs himſelf.</hi>

               <p>After having aſſur'd the ſaid <hi>Erlach</hi> of His Majeſty's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in, and Affection towards him, it will be neceſſary, before any Propoſitions are made to him, to know which he had rather do, either immediately to deliver the Town and Fortreſs of <hi>Briſac</hi> into the King's Hands, receiving a fair Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; or to take a freſh Commiſſion from His Majeſty, to keep the ſaid Government for His Majeſty's Service; taking an Oath before the ſaid <hi>Guebriant,</hi> well and faithfully to keep the ſame for His ſaid Majeſty, and him therein well and faithfully to ſerve, towards and againſt all; adding what the ſaid Count <hi>Guebriant</hi> and Baron <hi>d'Oyſenville</hi> ſhall think moſt proper to oblige him the more ſtrictly.</p>

               <p>If he conſents to take a reward for it, the King is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give him a 100000 Livers in ready money, and even allows the ſaid <hi>Guebriant</hi> to go as far as 50000 Crowns.</p>
               <p>If he had rather remain in the place, his Majeſty will leave him the command of it on the ſame Conditions he made with the ſaid Duke; and moreover will allow him a Penſion of 6000 Crowns a Year, during the War. And in order to ſecure him a livelihood after the Peace, his Majeſty allows the ſaid Count and Baron to make him a promiſe in his Name, of the like Summ of 18000 Livers revenue on his Demeſne, which he ſhall enter in poſſeſſion of after the Concluſion of the Peace</p>
               <p>If the ſaid Sieur <hi>d' Erlach</hi> is willing to keep the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid Place, reaſon, and his own ſecurity require, his receiving ſo conſiderable a number of <hi>French Men,</hi> into his ſaid Garriſon, that in caſe he ſhould infortunately be ſurpriz'd by Death, like the aforeſaid Duke, a Lieutenant that is to be ſettled under him, and ſecur'd to his Majeſty like himſelf, might be able to ſecure the ſaid place for his Majeſty. And in that caſe the ſaid Count <hi>Guebriant</hi> and he are to agree about a Lieutenant, in whom his Majeſty may confide, and if poſſible a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> choſen by the ſaid Count; as alſo to put a good <hi>French</hi> Garriſon into it at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>To avoid the difficulties and diſturbances that might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe about the adjuſting of this ſecond propoſition, in caſe the ſaid <hi>Erlach</hi> be diſpoſed to deliver the ſaid place into the ſaid Count <hi>Guebriant</hi>'s Hands, whom his Majeſty in that caſe deſigns to make Governour thereof; he allows the ſaid Count and <hi>Oyſonville</hi> to grant him, if it cannot be done otherwiſe, as far as 200000 Livers to be paid to him in ready Money.</p>
               <p>The ſaid <hi>Guebriant</hi> and <hi>d' Oyſonville</hi> are to manage this affair with ſo much prudence and addreſs, as not to give him the leaſt diſguſt, ſo that whatever he reſolves upon, he may have reaſon to be ſatisfy'd with his Majeſty's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards him.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Count <hi>Guebriant</hi> is alſo to treat with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the other places held by the ſaid Duke; in order to their delivering of the ſame into his Majeſty's hands, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a reward for them, proportionable to the value of the ſaid Governments; or elſe taking freſh Commiſſions from the King, together with an Oath of Fidelity as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid.</p>

               <p>In caſe the ſaid Governors are deſirous to remain in their ſaid Governments, they are to allow them Penſions, according as they ſhall think fit, and to promiſe them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues upon their Demean, inſtead of the ſaid Penſions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Peace, proportionable to their deſerts.</p>
               <p>As to the Garriſons that are on this ſide the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as <hi>Thanes, Pentarlier,</hi> and others, the ſaid Count <hi>Guebriant</hi> is to get them immediately deliver'd into his Majeſty's Hands, and to put ſuch Perſons into them, as he knows to be both Capable and Faithful to Command the ſame.</p>
               <p>And in caſe after having made the Covenants above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the Commanders of the Forces, and Governors of Places ſhould make ſome difficulty of taking the Oath purely and only to the King, and ſhould be deſirous to add that they well keep their Garriſons for the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and for the advantage of the common cauſe, the ſaid Count is to ſhow them how the aforeſaid Duke himſelf, by the ſecret Article, of which a Copy is to be annex'd to this preſent Inſtruction, acknowledg'd none but the King, and that reaſon cannot allow their doing leſs in this, than he.</p>
               <p>The ſaid <hi>Guebriant</hi> and <hi>Oyſonville</hi> are to acquaint all the Troops of the ſaid Army, that the King will take ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care of what relates to them, that he deſigns to give them the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> for their General; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that his Majeſty will repair in Perſon, as far as his Frontier Towns of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which are upon the <hi>Saoſne</hi> to ſhew the particular eſteem he has for their whole body.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE ſaid Colonel has been very favourably receiv'd, and has expreſs'd a great deal of ſatisfaction at his departure for the favours and careſſes he has receiv'd from his Majeſty, as well as for the good Treatment he has met with from the Cardinal, which they will ſee the particulars of by Monſieur <hi>de Noyers</hi> diſpatches.</p>
               <p>The ſubject of his Journey is reduc'd into four principal points, of which the above nam'd Gentlemen will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly inform'd, by the Copy of the Memoir he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, which will be annex'd hereunto.</p>
               <p>The firſt conſiſts in the aſſurances of the Service and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of the ſaid Colonels and Officers of the Army, which his Majeſty has receiv'd with particular demonſtrations of ſatisfaction expreſs'd <hi>Viva Voce</hi> to the ſaid Colonel, the which are contain'd in the Letter written by him to the ſaid Directors, of which a Copy will alſo be added to theſe preſent Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>Whereupon it is his Majeſty's deſire that the ſaid Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, do omit nothing to confirm to this Army, the good diſpoſition his Majeſty is in of taking a particular care of their intereſt and advantage.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Article of the ſaid Memoir contains the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand made by the ſaid Colonels, of the continuation of the Treaty, and the payment of the ſaid Army; in the ſame manner as it was done in the late Duke's time. And upon this point, and all others that are Eſſential, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty referrs himſelf abſolutely to the ſaid Sieurs <hi>de Guebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, de Choiſy</hi> and <hi>d' Oyſonville,</hi> according as he has declar'd to the ſaid Colonel <hi>Flerskin,</hi> and to the Directors by his

Letter; ſuppoſing that thoſe affairs may be adjuſted with leſs difficulty upon the place, than here. therefore they are to acquaint the ſaid directors, that his majeſty ſeeing no likelihood that any of them would oblige himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, for the maintenance of an army of 8000 foot and 4000 horſe, together with the train of artillery, and other things relating to the subſiſtence and employment of ſuch an army, as the aforeſaid duke had done, ſince it would not be in his power to effect it, it will be neceſſary to think on ſuch means as are moſt proper to regulate all things in a due method, for the common satisfaction of all; and ſuch an one as may produce the ſame effect of a treaty. whereupon, it will be fit to add, in order to remove that thought, that the inexecution of treaties of that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence occaſions more than any other thing, the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents which may ariſe among thoſe whoſe intentions are the moſt united in the ſame party: that there would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ariſe a very eſſential difficulty which is, that his majeſty finding himſelf laden with the ſame expence the duke was at, for the maintenance of the gariſons he was in poſſeſſion of, would be oblig'd to make deductions of the payments deſign'd for the generality of the forces, in order to find the funds of thoſe gariſons, and to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them from thoſe of the field; which would occaſion abundance of diſcontents and confuſion, before a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtinction could be made, to ſatisfie every body. so that all that can be done, is, that his majeſty's ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties muſt determine with the aforeſaid directors, what is moſt proper to be done, to give every one a reaſonable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>The Re-inforcement of Men which the ſaid Colonel <hi>Fler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchin</hi> has deſir'd, and is the Third Article of his Memorial bearing his Credentials, is that which diſturbs His Majeſty moſt: For, notwithſtanding he finds in himſelf a great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to do it, being ſenſible of the Advantage his Affairs, and thoſe of his Allies in <hi>Germany,</hi> would receive by it; the Number of Armies he is oblig'd to keep on foot, as all the World knows; and particularly, the War of <hi>Italy,</hi> which has drawn a World of Men out of his Kingdom, and obliges him at this very time to ſend a conſiderable Number of Forces thither, hinder His Majeſty from being able to give them a definitive Anſwer to this Point for the preſent. But he is not out of hopes of giving them a conſiderable Succour, particularly on the ſide of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> where his Affairs continuing to proſper, as he hopes in God they will,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42519:281"/>
His Majeſty will be able to ſend all the Forces under Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi>'s Command in their Parts: And in his Progreſs towards <hi>Lyons,</hi> whither he is now a going, he will acquaint the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> who is ſhortly to repair into <hi>Germany,</hi> with his ſinal Reſolution uopn this Subject; which is what the ſaid Deputies are to ſay upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</p>
               <p>As to what relates to the reſt of the extraordinary Funds demanded by the ſaid Colonel <hi>Flerſchin,</hi> mention'd in the fourth and laſt Article of his Memorial, His Majeſty refers providing for the ſame, until his being better ſatisfy'd of the neceſſity of raiſing the ſaid Funds, in order to do it with more Knowledge: Which is what may be ſaid at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the ſaid Directors. And therefore he will expect an Account thereof from the ſaid Deputies.</p>
               <p>After having inform'd them in general Terms, what Anſwer they may make to the ſaid Directors, upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands made by Colonel <hi>Flerſchin</hi> in their behalf, and that of all the Officers in the Army; it is neceſſary for them to know, that the main thing they are to aim at, is, to ſecure all the Forces, and the Gariſons, which were under the aforeſaid Duke's Command, for His Majeſty's Service; and to eſtabliſh ſo good an Order for the Subſiſtence of both, that His Majeſty may be able to bear the Expence thereof.</p>
               <p>That it will be neceſſary, if poſſible, to order Matters ſo, that all the Forces in the Field, and in the Gariſons, may not coſt His Majeſty more than the 800000 Crowns, which he allow'd the ſaid Duke: Which ſeems the more feaſible, by reaſon that it is moſt certain, that the ſaid Duke has leſt great Summs of Money, though he drew them out of no other Mine than His Majeſty's Treaſury, and the Profits of the War.</p>
               <p>That, in order to bring this about, it is fit to examine what the Country round about <hi>Briſac,</hi> and the other Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is able to contribute towards the Maintenance of the ſaid Gariſons; and in the next place, what the ſaid Duke did really pay to his Forces, what the Artillery is to coſt; and upon thoſe Foundations, to make a right Calculation of all the Expences of the ſaid Army. Nevertheleſs, if it ſhould chance to amount to ſomething more than the ſaid Summ of 800000 Crowns, His Majeſty is willing to bear it. But at the ſame time, it is his expreſs Command, that the ſaid Deputies do uſe all the good Husbandry that is poſſible therein.</p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:42519:281"/>
               <p>His Majeſty is of Opinion, that it will be proper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Knowledge be given of this Account to the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, to ſtate it with the Sieur <hi>d'Erlach,</hi> who ſhews ſo much Zeal and Affection for the Service of <hi>France,</hi> that His Majeſty is confident he will uſe his beſt Endeavours to make that Account reaſonable. This, it is thought, will prove the leſs difficult, becauſe His Majeſty is reſolv'd to uſe the ſaid Colonels well; and moreover, to ſecure them wherewithal to live after the Peace; which the ſaid Deputies are impower'd to do by their Inſtructions. This, undoubtedly, will induce them to make their Soldiers ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Although His Majeſty has explain'd himſelf very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Inſtruction of the ſaid Deputies, as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Oath to be taken by the Governors of Places; Nevertheleſs, he thinks fit to re-iterate, that they muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that they hold the ſaid Governments by virtue of His Majeſty's Commiſſions; and oblige themſelves to keep them towards all, and againſt all, for his Service; and never to deliver them to any whatever, without His Majeſty's expreſs Command.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe thought fit, according to Monſieur <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyer</hi>'s Letter to the Sieur <hi>d'Erlach,</hi> of which the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties will receive a Copy, to eſtabliſh <hi>French</hi> Governors in <hi>Rinfeld</hi> and <hi>Newburg,</hi> or <hi>Friburg.</hi> And this the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties are to contrive with the ſaid <hi>Erlach,</hi> ſatisfying the Governors of the ſaid Places with good Penſions, which they ſhall enjoy immediately, and with the Revenue that is to be ſettl'd upon them at the ſame time, which they are to enjoy after the Peace; or by ſuch other Conditions as the ſaid Deputies ſhall think reaſonable.</p>
               <p>As to the Propoſition contain'd in the preceding Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to ſound whether the ſaid <hi>Erlach</hi> would be willing to remit <hi>Briſac</hi> into His Majeſty's hands, he expreſſes ſo much Affection for his Service, and he is known to be ſo well experienc'd, and capable of commanding in ſuch an important Place, that in caſe he is willing to remain in it, His Majeſty is ſatisfy'd that he can put no Man in his room that can ſerve him better than he. And His Majeſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the ſaid Deputies to acquaint him, that if he had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Governments equal to that, he would give him the Choice of all of them. In a word; His Behaviour ſince the Accident of the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi>'s Death, gives reaſon to believe, that his future Actions will always anſwer ſo good a Beginning.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:42519:282"/>
               <p>The ſaid Deputies are ſo well acquainted with all His Majeſty's Intentions, and are ſo prudent, that he does not doubt but all things will ſucceed according to his Deſires, by their good Conduct.</p>

THE Officers of the Army do proteſt, that they are willing and deſirous to ſerve His Majeſty and the common Cauſe faithfully and conſtantly, for the Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Princes and States that are oppreſs'd, and diſpoſſeſs'd; as they are oblig'd to do by the Treaties made between His Majeſty, and His Highneſs, of bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; which they deſire to obſerve in all their Points and Clauſes.</p>

And whereas it is thought, that the Money His Majeſty will be pleas'd to aſſign for the Maintenance of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, will be diſtributed to more Advantage by his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer's Hands, than by any others: The Officers freely agree, not to meddle with it, provided His Majeſty will be pleas'd to pay them four Muſters a Year, according to the Capitulation made with them during His Highneſs's Life; and that the Money be paid without Loſs or Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in good Species, and ſuch as are current in this Country; Piſtoles of Weight not paſſing at a higher Rate here than four Rix-Dollers, and other Species in proportion to the Piſtoles, all being weighty and good.</p>

AS His Majeſty's only Intention is, to re-eſtabliſh the Princes and States that are oppreſs'd in <hi>Germany,</hi> and to promote the Advantage of the common Cauſe, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which was commanded by His late Highneſs being maintain'd and paid by His Majeſty, he never queſtion'd, but that the Officers thereof would freely promiſe to ſerve him faithfully and conſtantly, towards and againſt all; and to lead the ſaid Army in all the Plates and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes he ſhall deſire, according as His Highneſs was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to do by the Treaty of the 27th of <hi>October,</hi> 1635.

And though ſome hints have been given, that it would be more proper to pay the Army with a certain number of Muſters, the King taking all the other expences upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than to agree about a ſumm for the whole, as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty did with his Highneſs. We hope the Officers will do us more juſtice than to believe that it did proceed from the leaſt apprehenſion that the diſtribution of the ſaid ſumms would not be well and duly perform'd by their order; but on the contrary, that they will rather conſider the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which have been alledg'd to them, and are moſt true. They will alſo be pleas'd to conſider that the four Muſters they deſire far exceeding, together with the Ammunitions and Proviſions, and other extraordinary Expences, the ſumm his Majeſty did allow to his late Highneſs, as alſo that which they themſelves have deſir'd of his Majeſty by their Deputies; they do reduce us to the impoſſibility of granting them, ſince our Inſtructions limit our Power within the bounds of the demands which the ſaid Officers have made to his Majeſty. Nevertheleſs, in order to ſhew them what confidence we repoſe in the particular eſteem the King has for them, and for the whole Army, we are willing to allow them three Muſters and a half yearly, the ſaid half Muſter to be imploy'd for the recruits and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of the Forces; this is all we can do, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42519:284"/>
upwards of a Hundred Thouſand Dollers more than what they have deſir'd of his Majeſty. The whole will be paid them in weighty Piſtols, at the rate of four Rix Dollers a piece, or in Equivalent Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>III.</label>

As for the Quarter of <hi>May,</hi> and that of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> we muſt firſt agree when His late Highneſs's Treaty will ceaſe, and when that of the Muſters will begin, in order to make a juſt Account with the Officers of His late Highneſs, of what has been furniſh'd to them this Year, as well for the King's Intereſt, as for that of the whole Army.</p>

               <p>THE King will yearly cauſe to be paid into the hands of the Sieur <hi>Haeuff,</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> the Summ of ...... in four Terms, and equal Payments; of which, the firſt will be due on the Firſt of <hi>January</hi> next coming; to be employ'd for the Maintenance of the Army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by His late Highneſs of <hi>Saxony</hi> of <hi>Weymar,</hi> for the Payment of the Loans for the <hi>German</hi> Gariſons that are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Places that are already, and are to be conquer'd; for the Equipages of the Artillery, Proviſions, Furniſhing of Ammunition-Bread, and all other Warlike Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that will be neceſſary, as well as for the Payments of the Works that are to be done in Sieges, and other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes that ſhall be thought neceſſary.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty will alſo immediately pay for the Quarter of <hi>May,</hi> due to His late Highneſs, in performance of the Treaties made with him, the Summ of 550000 Livres on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the 50000 Livres remaining of the 600000 Livres grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for every Quarter, not being allow'd, according to the ſaid Treaties, for the Army, but for the particular Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of His late Highneſs.</p>
               <p>As alſo, His ſaid Majeſty will pay on the Firſt of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> next coming the Sum of 250000 Livres, which is all that remains due for the Quarter of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> by reaſon that His Majeſty having paid the Sum of 300000 Livres extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to His late Highneſs, to be employ'd for the Buying of Horſes and Proviſions, to enable him to remount his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, and to raiſe 4000 <hi>German</hi> Foot, to be join'd to the <hi>French</hi> Body; the ſame not having been perform'd by him, the ſaid Summ of 300000 Livres muſt have been found in his Coffers at the time of his Death; and conſequently, his Treaſurers muſt be reſponſible for the ſame to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And therefore His ſaid Majeſty paying the ſaid Sum of 250000 Livres on the Terms aboveſaid, is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd of the Payment of the ſaid Quarter of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as it has been obſerv'd already, in relation to the Quarter of <hi>May,</hi> His Majeſty has the ſame reaſon to detain the 50000 Livres which were granted by him, to His late Highneſs, every Quarter, for his Maintenance.</p>

               <p>In like manner, the ſaid Directors are to oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves firmly to His ſaid Majeſty, one for all, to maintain him an Army in a good and ſufficient Condition, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of 8000 Foot well arm'd, and 4000 Horſe alſo well arm'd and mounted, with a Train of 500 Horſes for the Ordnance, 400 for the Proviſions, and ......

               <p>The ſaid Directors are alſo to oblige themſelves to pay four Muſters yearly to the Forces of the ſaid Army that are in the Field, giving them the ſame Pay they had from His late Highneſs; ten Muſters yearly to the Field-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the ſaid Army, and the like Number to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Train of Artillery and Proviſions: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to deduct out of the Money that ſhall be paid eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Quarter of the ſaid ...... ſuch Summs as ſhall be agreed on for the Payment of the Loans, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ammunition-Bread, to the <hi>German</hi> Forces that are

to remain in thoſe Places that are already, and are to be conquer'd hereafter.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Directors are alſo to oblige themſelves, daily to provide for every Foot-Soldier of the ſaid Army ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Field, an Ammunition Loaf weighing 24 Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, well condition'd; the ſame to the Cavalry, when Need ſhall require it. Moreover, they are to provide for Sieges, and other Expeditions, as well for the Soldiers of the ſaid Army, as for ſuch as His Majeſty ſhall think fit to join with them, ſuch Warlike Ammunitions as ſhall be thought neceſſary by the General His ſaid Majeſty will be pleas'd to ſend to Command the ſaid Army. And in caſe Money ſhould be wanting for ſome Works, or other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, the ſaid Directors ſhall be oblig'd to provide the ſame by the General's Order; as alſo, for the Maintenance and Conduct of Boats, and Payment of the Water-men, that ſhall be neceſſary for Ports, Paſſages, or Rowing.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Directors are alſo to oblige themſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to the laſt Will of His late Highneſs, forthwith to deliver into His Majeſty's Hands all the conquer'd Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; into which His Majeſty is to place ſuch Governors, either <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Germans,</hi> as he ſhall think fit; and to leave in the ſaid Gariſons ſuch a Number of <hi>German</hi> Soldiers as ſhall be agreed on between the ſaid Directors and His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Deputies.</p>
               <p>And whereas His ſaid Majeſty would never engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuch an extraordinary Expence, for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the ſaid Army, unleſs he had a Mind to have it always in a good Condition to ſerve: For that Reaſon, as ſoon as the Summs proceeding from the ſaid ...... ſhall be paid into the hands of the ſaid <hi>Haeuff,</hi> the ſaid Directors are to give notice thereof to the General who ſhall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſaid Army, in order to carry the ſaid Money, by his, and the ſaid Directors Orders, to the ſaid Army; where, immediately after the Re-view of the ſaid Forces by the Commiſſaries and Comptrollers appointed by the ſaid General, the aforeſaid Muſters are to be paid, as aboveſaid. Out of which Summs, the ſaid General is to deduct from the ſaid Directors, at every Muſter, at the rate of 12 Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres for every Foot-Soldier, and 40 for every Trooper, that ſhall be wanting of the Number of Men the ſaid Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors will oblige themſelves to keep on foot in the ſaid Army, by the four preſent Articles.

And it ſhall be lawful for the ſaid General to make a Re-view of the Officers, and Trains of Artillery and Proviſions, as often as he ſhall think fit, in order to make the like Deduction for whatever ſhall be wanting; and the ſaid Directors ſhall be oblig'd to provide anew for the ſame.</p>
               <p>In caſe any Officers, Soldiers, or Troopers of the ſaid Forces ſhould chance to be made Priſoners, the ſaid Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors are to take care to deliver them, paying their Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, if need be.</p>

               <p>and deliver them into his Hands, to eſtabliſh Governors there: That otherwiſe, we had labour'd long in vain for the compoſing of all that is aboveſaid. Upon this Point, they deſir'd to have our Intentions in Writing; which we ſent to them in this manner: That the conquer'd Places ſhould be deliver'd into His Majeſty's Hands, for him to ſettle ſuch Governors there as he ſhould think fit; as alſo, to put <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Gariſons there, according to His Highneſs's laſt Will and Teſtament. Having ſent this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle to Major-General <hi>Erlach,</hi> he ſent us word, that it was neceſſary to communicate it to the whole Army: That Colonel <hi>Ohem,</hi> who was going back to his Quarters, would take that Care upon him; And that after that, he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with their Reſolutions. Five or ſix Days paſs'd without any News; during which, we did not fail to preſs the ſaid <hi>Erlach;</hi> and he, to make perpetual Complaints of the Delays of the March of the <hi>French</hi> Forces; which, he ſaid, put a full Stop to the Concluſion of our Buſineſs. Finally, Having receiv'd Orders to make the Army, Commanded by Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> advance; and at the ſame time, Letters from the ſaid <hi>du Hallier,</hi> giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the March of his Forces; we gave him an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof: Upon which, he took Occaſion the very next Day to write to the Officers of the Army, that it was time to aſſemble again: And we were glad to have the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly kept at <hi>Colmar,</hi> to the end that the Duke of <hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>'s Preſence might advance it. During the firſt Days of our Conference, renew'd at <hi>Colmar,</hi> we were oblig'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin all almoſt <hi>de Nova</hi> again. They increas'd their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and we drew the inclos'd Articles, as if nothing had been ſpoken of till then. In Anſwer to our Article concerning the Gariſons, they ſent us word at firſt, by two Deputies from among them, That all the Gariſons ſhould remain in the Power of the Body of the Army; and that they would provide ſuch Governors and Gariſons for them as they ſhould think fit, excepting only <hi>Briſac;</hi> in which the King ſhould be allow'd to put a third part of <hi>French-men,</hi> becauſe His Majeſty, by a Re-inforcement of Men, had contributed towards the Taking of it: And the ſaid Deputies added, That it was the laſt Reſolution of their Aſſembly; refuſing even to hear our Reaſons; which, nevertheleſs, we made them hear at laſt, in a very ample manner, without being able any wiſe to alter their Minds. This oblig'd us, in order not to break with them, to tell them, That our Inſtructions did not authorize us to grant their
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42519:287"/>
Demands: That it was neceſſary that they and we ſhould ſend to the King, to know his Intenſions; That, in the mean time, to ſhew them in what good Union we deſir'd to live with them, the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> was ready to join his Forces with thoſe of His late Highneſs of <hi>Weymar,</hi> in order to march together towards the County of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and not to paſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> ſince we were certain that His Majeſty would never reſolve to do it, without being Maſter of <hi>Briſac.</hi> This ſtartl'd the Deputies, who were in hopes, that while the Article of the Gariſons was in debate, we would help them to take their Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which cannot be good without paſſing the <hi>Rhine.</hi> Nevertheleſs, being parted thus, at Night Count <hi>Guebriant</hi> met Major-General <hi>Erlach,</hi> who came from the Duke <hi>de Longueville;</hi> with whom having had ſome Diſcourſe, they renew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He withdrew diſ-ſatisfy'd, without expreſſing it; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Dinner, took Coach, and return'd to <hi>Briſac.</hi> All the other Officers and Colonels return'd in the ſame manner to their Quarters, leaving only the Auditor-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral behind, to deſire us to fix our Reſolution: With whom, after ſeveral Debates, we drew the Article concerning the ſaid Gariſons, as it is ſtated; and put it into his hands, to confer about it with the Colonels. He ſent it to Colonel <hi>Ohem,</hi> and came the next Day to <hi>Briſac;</hi> where <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Monſieur</hi> de Choiſy.</note> I repair'd alſo, to convoy the Wheat that came from <hi>Baſil.</hi> Two Hours after my Arrival, the General-Major, and the Governor of <hi>Rheinfeld</hi> came to ſee me. We examin'd all the Articles we ſend you; upon which he alledg'd no Difficulties, excepting that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Gariſons. Finding at the very beginning of the ſaid Article, that a Sub-Governor was mention'd, he ſaid, That he would have none; and the Governor of <hi>Rheinfeld</hi> ſaid the ſame thing: In the next place, That he was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the Army would perſiſt in deſiring an Aſſurance
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42519:288"/>
from the King, that he would put no Governor into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac</hi> and <hi>Friburg,</hi> but ſuch as ſhould be drawn out of the <hi>German</hi> Body: and that the Governors would take no other Oath, than to keep the ſaid Places for the King's and Confederate Princes Service; and never to deliver them to any body, without the King's Leave. I told him the Reaſons which would hinder the King always from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to it in this manner: To which I had no other Anſwer, but That it was his Opnion, that we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtain what we deſir'd in this Point. And, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, he told me the Obſtinacy he had found in all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, on that Subject: That, for his part, he diſcharg'd himſelf of it, and could not anſwer for the Sequel. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half an Hour afterwards he ſent me word, that he had juſt receiv'd a Letter from the Crown of <hi>Sueden,</hi> directed to the Directors, by which they were deſir'd to remember that the Army belong'd to the ſaid Crown. This oblig'd me to write that very Night to Meſſieurs <hi>de Guebriant</hi> and <hi>d'Oyſonville,</hi> to acquaint them with all thoſe Difficulties, and the Reaſons I had to conclude as advantageouſly as was poſſible. Two Hours after the Receipt of my Letter, and their having conferr'd with the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> they repair'd hither; where it was their Opinion that I ſhould wait on Major-General <hi>Erlach,</hi> to tell him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, that we could not go beyond what we had granted by the laſt Articles; that our Power was at an end; and that if the Army was not ſatisfy'd with it, it was fit to ſend to the King again. He repeated with much Diſquiet, as I thought, that it behov'd us to take care leſt Things ſhould take an ill Biaſs before the Return of the Courier we ſhould ſend; and that afterwards we ſhould fall into the Proverb, <hi>Such refuſe, who afterwards muſe.</hi> I repeat the ſame Words to you: Upon which, I preſs'd him to tell me what great Reaſon there was to doubt. I ask'd him if he had any Notice of ſome other Treaty, to the prejudice of ours: Whether he was afraid of any Treaſon in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or in the Governors. He could alledge none to me; but that the Army was abſolutely ruin'd, in caſe it remain'd ſome Days longer without marching. After having felt his Pulſe, he made great Complaints to me againſt Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon, I reply'd to him, that it behov'd him to take care, leſt he
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:42519:288"/>
were turn'd out of his Government: That it would be a great Affront to him: That he knew what we had offer'd to him, what Engagements he had made to the Court: That it behov'd him only to ſpeak; and that he ſhould not want a ſufficient Aſſiſtance. This produc'd no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and thus we parted; he ſaying, that we ſhould tarry for the Anſwer of Colonel <hi>Ohem,</hi> and the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, about the Articles of the ſaid Places. I acquainted Meſſieurs <hi>de Guebriant</hi> and <hi>d'Oyſonville</hi> with this Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: We weigh'd all the Reaſons on both ſides, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Hardſhips of the Treaty they would impoſe on the King; as alſo, the hazard we ſhould run, if, in delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Army ſhould chance to take another Party, and the Gariſons find Means to ſubſiſt without us; as they might do for a while, if having each Wheat enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt for a whole Year, at leaſt, for the moſt conſiderable; all the Colonels following the Advice of the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſhould make a Reſolution to join their Forces to thoſe of <hi>Koningſmark,</hi> a <hi>Suede:</hi> From whence it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Crown of <hi>Sueden,</hi> in purſuance of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made with His Majeſty, would oblige him to ſend an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Army into <hi>Germany;</hi> or would take an Occaſion to make a Peace with the Emperor, without our Leave. I am ſenſible that this Expedient, propos'd by the Reſident of <hi>Sueden,</hi> is not the moſt advantageous for thoſe Forces; by reaſon that, in the firſt place, before their Conjunction, they are neceſſitated to croſs a large Country belonging to the Enemy; where they would be in danger of a Defeat: Beſides, that at the time of their quitting theſe Quarters, all the Officers would be oblig'd to break their Equipages, to mount their Infantry; which is a thing, <hi>German<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> would hardly reſolve upon. Moreover, I am of Opinion, that they are not over-fond of the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Command; that on that ſide they can draw no Money from them; and that, ſince they are ſo loth to receive the abſolute Commands of a potent King, they will much more unwillingly ſubmit to thoſe of <hi>Koningſmark,</hi> who is but a Colonel, like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Propoſitions have alſo been made to them to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton themſelves in this Country, and to make a Republick; which is a mere Chimera: But we have to deal with ſuch unreaſonable Men, that not being capable to know their own Good, they may chance to be hurry'd away, following, the Paſſion of one Man, who may have a Mind to eſtabliſh his Authority above the reſt.

their Propoſitions about the Gariſons, to declare unto them, that we had no power to grant what they deſir'd; and that it was neceſſary to ſend a Deputation to the King. The reſt conſider'd, that though, in effect, their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions oblig'd them to ſecure the Army in the moſt direct manner, in the King's Service, according to the ſecret Treaty of His late Highneſs; and that, by another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the ſaid Inſtructions, it is expreſly provided, that in caſe any Difficulties ſhould ariſe on the part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Places, and Officers of the Army, about the Taking of the Oath purely and ſimply to the King; and that they ſhould be deſirous to add, that they will keep the ſaid Gariſons for the King's Service, and the Good of the common Cauſe; they muſt be made ſenſible, how the ſaid Duke himſelf, by the ſecret Article, acknowledg'd none but the King: And that Reaſon does not allow their doing leſs in this, than he. Which are Words that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage the Deputies to ſuit, as much as can be, their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation to His Majeſty's entire Satisfaction; but yet do not deciſively expreſs, that for want of that, the King will hearken to no manner of Treaty. Seeing moreover, that by all the Letters we have receiv'd from His Majeſty, and Monſieur <hi>de Noyers,</hi> ſince the Beginning of our Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are always injoin'd not to break it off: And that by a Third Inſtruction, ſent to us upon the Propoſitions of Colonel <hi>Flerſchin,</hi> when Mention is made of the Oath to be taken by the Governors of Places, it is ſaid in expreſs Words. <hi>Although His Majeſty has very clearly acquainted the ſaid Deputi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, by their Inſtructions, in what manner he is of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the Governors ought to take their Oath of Fidelity.</hi> Which Expreſſion, <hi>He is of Opinion,</hi> ſhews, that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty refers it to us, to compoſe all things as advantageouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as is poſſible, for his Service. After all; Whether our Inſtructions do not bind us ſo faſt, but that we may go beyond the Words of the Oath, therein ſet down; or whether we may not exceed them, without endangering our Heads; conſidering all the Accidents above-noted, and another which is moſt certain, That in ſending to the Court without a Concluſion, we muſt paſs at leaſt a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night longer, before we can receive Orders; and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Receipt of thoſe Orders, we muſt ſpend ſeven or eight Days longer to aſſemble the Officers again, and as much to make the Preparations of our Departure: That all this time would lead us very far into <hi>November,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of the Means of taking our Winter-Quarters;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42519:289"/>
and conſequently, that this Army would be infallibly ruin'd, or we forc'd to lodge them in <hi>France;</hi> conſidering alſo, that it is better to take ſome Poſſeſſion of what we deſire, than to have none at all: That by the Means of the half <hi>French</hi> Gariſon in <hi>Briſac,</hi> Matters being well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, the King will always be Maſter of it, according to his Pleaſure; and that, in caſe of Neceſſity, it were better to venture the Loſs of the Army, to gain it. I had rather, being able to defend my ſelf with good Reaſons, run the hazard of being diſown'd, and of loſing my Life, than to ſurvive the Reproach which the King, His Eminence, and all <hi>France,</hi> might upbraid me with, in caſe the Forces of the late Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Briſac,</hi> the moſt important in all <hi>Europe,</hi> ſhould paſs into any Hands beſides the King's. Founded upon theſe Reaſons, my Opinion is, That if thoſe we are to treat with, will not ſubmit to our Terms, we muſt agree to theirs; ſend our <hi>French</hi> Gariſon into <hi>Briſac,</hi> with ſome choſen Officers; and march with the Army. Count <hi>Guebriant</hi> is of the ſame Opinion; but Baron <hi>d'Oyſonville</hi>'s Sentiments are different from ours; perhaps they are better. While the aforeſaid Colonel's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was expected, the ſaid Count and Baron thought fit to ſend me to <hi>Colmar,</hi> to give the Duke of <hi>Longuoville</hi> an Account of all thoſe Tranſactions, and to receive his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which I found to be very different from Monſieur <hi>Guebriant</hi>'s Opinion, and mine. Nevertheleſs, having made him ſenſible of the Importance of the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Army; and that it would infallibly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, if we ſhould tarry for new Orders from the Court; he told me, that he would agree; and that, inſtead of marching with the Forces towards the County of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> as it had been propos'd, he would make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of joining immediately with the <hi>German</hi> Body, and go up the <hi>Rhine</hi> again, towards <hi>Landaw, Guerinſen</hi> and <hi>Spire,</hi> to make himſelf Maſter of them, and to be in a Condition to paſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to take Winter-Quarters in the <hi>Lower Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate,</hi> as ſoon as the Oath was agreed on. The Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> added moreover, that by his Advice we might agree in all things except the Oath; That it would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, before our joining, to ſend half the <hi>French</hi> Gai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

perſiſt in my Opinion, to paſs the Oath on the Conditions propos'd by the Directors, and the Officers of the Army, rather than run the hazard of ſome unexpected Accident. The rather too, becauſe the laſt Clauſe of the ſaid Oath, by which the Governors promiſe never to deliver up the Place to any whatever, without the King's Leave, ſeems to ſecure all: And that His Majeſty having his Choice, to take what Governor he ſhall think ſit out of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Body, it will be very eaſie to ſecure thoſe he will put into the ſaid Gariſons, before he gives them their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions.</p>

                  <hi>First,</hi> His Majeſty grants, and expects, that the Forces commanded by the late Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> ſhall remain in one Body, as he ſeem'd to deſire it by his laſt Will and Teſtament; and that under the Direction of the Officers that have been nominated.</p>
               <p>That the Artillery ſhall ſtill be Commanded by the ſame Officers, who had the Command of it under the late Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> and commonly join'd to the <hi>German</hi> Body;
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42519:290"/>
and that the <hi>French</hi> Mareſchals de Camp, and the Directors of the <hi>German</hi> Forces, ſhall have the Power to give them ſuch Orders as ſhall be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>That in caſe (which God forbid) the ſaid Army, or part thereof, ſhould chance to be ruin'd by ſome ill Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of War, or other inevitable Accident, the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to grant the Officers extraordinary Means, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit the ſaid Forces, and put themſelves in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to continue their Services.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty alſo promiſes, forthwith to pay the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>May,</hi> in ready Money, amounting to 200000 Crowns; to be employ'd for the Payment of a Muſter for the whole Army: As alſo, to furniſh in good valuable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignations 600000 Livres more, for the Third Quarter of this preſent Year, due on the laſt Day of <hi>September</hi> laſt. Out of which 600000 Livres of the Third Quarter, the Directors and Officers of the ſaid Army are to employ 300000 Livres to re-mount their Cavalry, and to put their Forces in a good Condition.</p>
               <p>Moreover, His Majeſty promiſes to allow all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both Horſe and Foot, of which the ſaid Body ſhall be compos'd, three Quarters and an half yearly, according to the Capitulation they had made with the late Duke of <hi>Weymar;</hi> of which they ſhall be oblig'd immediately to give a Copy to His Majeſty's Deputies: The ſaid Half Muſter to be employ'd by the Officers, for Recruits, and for the Re-eſtabliſhment of their Forces; and the three Muſters, for the Payment of the Officers and Soldiers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Reviews that ſhall be made of them by the Commiſſaries and Comptrollers deputed by His Majeſty, for that effect. The firſt of which Muſters is to begin from this preſent Day, to be paid on the laſt Day of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> of the preſent Year; the two others, Quarterly; and the Half Muſter, on the laſt of <hi>September,</hi> 1640. and thus conſecutively. The whole ſhall be paid in weighty Piſtoles, at the Rate of four Rix-Dollers <hi>per</hi> Piſtole, and no more, or in equivalent Money.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty is alſo to pay to the General-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and to thoſe of the Artillery, eight Muſters year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the like Species as aforeſaid. As for the Officers of the Carriages, ſince there are Difficulties in the Maintenance of Horſes, Agreements ſhall be made with them, ſuitable to the Times and Reaſon; and that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sallaries allow'd them by the late Duke of <hi>Weymar:</hi> A Copy of the Capitulations or State of

               <p>His ſaid Majeſty is alſo to allow Ammunition-Bread, both to the Foot and Horſe, whether in the Field, or in Gariſons; without deducting any thing for the ſame out of the ſaid Muſters.</p>
               <p>If any of the Officers, Soldiers, or other particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons belonging to the ſaid Army, ſhall deſire His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to gratifie them with the Gift of ſome Lands and Houſes ſeated in a conquer'd Country, His Majeſty does promiſe to make ſuch Gratifications of the ſame to them, that every one of them ſhall have Reaſon to be ſatisfy'd.

               <p>It has been farther agreed, That the ſaid Duke ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently join the Forces he has with him at this time, as well as all thoſe he may have for the future, with the King's: That they ſhall take an Oath, well and faithfully to ſerve His Majeſty, under the ſaid Duke's Authority, towards, and againſt all thoſe he is at preſent in War with, in ſuch places, and in ſuch a manner, as he ſhall think fit: And that for the future they ſhall receive the ſame Pay in the Field as His Majeſty's do, on Condition, however, that they ſhall not be allow'd to take Winter-Quarters in <hi>France,</hi> but only in the ſaid Duke's Territories, or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Country.</p>
               <p>It has alſo been agreed, That the ſaid Duke ſhall not be allow'd to lodge any of the ſaid Troops nearer than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five Leagues of <hi>Nancy,</hi> whilſt the ſaid City ſhall remain as a Pledge.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:42519:293"/>
               <p>And whereas, notwithſtanding His Majeſty's reſtoring the ſaid Duke's Tervitories, as aboveſaid, there ſtill remain ſeveral Differences that were undecided before the War, in relation to the ſaid Territories, which are ſtill to be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>France,</hi> it is agreed, that they ſhall be determin'd amicably, as ſoon as can be.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Whereas ſince His Majeſty's having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd <hi>Lorrain</hi> by Force of Arms, a great Number of the Subjects of the ſaid Dutchy have ſerv'd His Majeſty, after having taken the Oath of Allegiance he has exacted from them, it is alſo agreed, that the ſaid Duke ſhall bear them no Ill Will for the ſame; but on the contrary, ſhall uſe them like his good and real Subjects, and ſhall pay them the Debts and Rents the State is oblig'd to pay. Which His Majeſty deſires ſo particularly, that unleſs he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd an abſolute Confidence in the Faith which the ſaid Duke has engag'd on that Subject, he would never have granted what he does by this Treaty, to the ſaid Duke.</p>
               <p>It is alſo agreed, That it ſhall not be in the power of the ſaid Duke to make the leaſt Alterations in the Benefices given by His Majeſty, to the very Day of this preſent Treaty: That thoſe who have been inveſted with them, ſhall remain in the peaceable Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment thereof, without the leaſt Diſturbance or Trouble from the ſaid Duke, or being diſ-poſſeſs'd of the ſame: And that His Majeſty ſhall continue to have the Diſpoſition of the Benefices of the City of <hi>Nancy,</hi> as long as the ſaid City re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for a Pledge in his hands; without changing the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the ſaid Benefices. And as for the Offices of the Criminal Juſtice, that are in the ſaid City of <hi>Nancy,</hi> they ſhall alſo remain in His Majeſty's Gift, to the end that ſuch as are inveſted with the ſame, may perform the Function thereof independently within the ſaid City, and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof: His Majeſty giving his Conſent to the ſaid Duke to transferr the Bayliwick of <hi>Nancy,</hi> into ſuch a place as he ſhall think fit, there to decide all the Differences, which were formerly judg'd in the ſaid Court of Juſtice of <hi>Nancy;</hi> excepting only ſuch as are above ſpecify'd.</p>
               <p>It is alſo agreed, That the ſaid Duke ſhall not be allow'd to ſend any Perſon into <hi>Nancy,</hi> there to reſide in his Name, unleſs it be to receive the Duties of his Demeſne, for which he ſhall be oblig'd to employ a <hi>French-man,</hi> approv'd by the King.</p>
               <p>It is moreover agreed, That the Conſiſcations that have been given by His Majeſty, of the Eſtates of ſuch as did
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42519:294"/>
bear Arms againſt him, ſhall remain valid, as to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the Revenues of the ſaid Eſtates, until the Day of the preſent Treaty; provided thoſe whoſe Eſtates have been confiſcated, quit the Service of His Majeſty's Enemies: In which Caſe, they ſhall be reſtor'd to the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and Enjoyment of their Eſtates; but without being allow'd to profecute or trouble thoſe who have enjoy'd them by virtue of the ſaid Gifts in any manner, or upon any pretence whatever.</p>
               <p>No mention is made in this Treaty, of the Difference between the ſaid Duke, and the Dutcheſs <hi>Nicolla</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> Daughter to the late Duke <hi>Henry,</hi> about their Marriage; by reaſon that the Deciſion thereof belongs only to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Tribunal; and that His Holineſs, before whom the Parties have brought their Cauſe, will do them Right, according to the Juſtice of the ſame. In the mean time, the ſaid Duke is to allow her, by way of Penſion, 120000 Livres, in <hi>French</hi> Money, yearly. And in order to make the ſaid Payment effective, it is agreed, that the ſaid Sum of 120000 Livres ſhall be taken Quarterly, out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of <hi>Bar;</hi> and in caſe that ſhould not ſuffiſe, out of the Salt-Pits of <hi>Roziers,</hi> and the Demeſne of <hi>Nuncy:</hi> And the ſaid Summ is to be depoſited into the hands of ſuch a Perſon as ſhall be nominated by His Majeſty, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to the ſaid Dutcheſs <hi>Nicolla</hi> of <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Contents above-written have been agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cardinal Duke of <hi>Richelieu</hi> for the King, and the ſaid Duke; who promiſes to perform whatever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the ſaid Treaty, with ſo much Fidelity and Stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, that he conſents, beſides what he leaves His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty by the ſame, in order to remain inſeparably united to the Crown, that all the Remainder of his Territories which His Majeſty does reſtore, and is to reſtore after the Peace, may devolve to the ſaid Crown, in caſe he does any wiſe deviate from the Tenour of this preſent Treaty.</p>

               <p>And whereas nothing but Time can abſolutely reſtore the Confidence His Majeſty did repoſe in the ſaid Duke, and which his Deportments towards him have made him loſe, it has been farther agreed, That whenever the ſaid Duke ſhall be abſent from His Majeſty, or out of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by his Order, he is not to live at <hi>Luneville,</hi> becauſe it is too near <hi>Nancy;</hi> and that whatever part of his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories he ſhall make his Abode in, he is to behave himſelf in ſuch a manner, that thoſe who ſhall Command in the Places that are to remain in Propriety, or as Pledges into His Majeſty's Hands, may have no Cauſe to conceive the leaſt leaſouſies thereof.</p>

               <p>IT is difficult to give juſt Meaſures about the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> becauſe it is moſt certain, that unleſs he be reduc'd to the utmoſt Extremity, he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe nothing but in order to deceive; and that in caſe he be reduc'd ſo to do, he can make none equal to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that may be deriv'd by taking him Priſoner.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> cannot be deſirous of ſtaying in <hi>Turin,</hi> with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with any Deſign, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her; and to take, under pretence of an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, to the prejudice of his Nephew, the ſame Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in his Territories, which he did pretend to by force.</p>
               <p>Therefore whatever Treaty ſuppoſes the ſtaying of Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> in the ſame place with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> is not only to be look'd on as ſuſpicious, but is to be abſolutely rejected.</p>
               <p>It behoves thoſe who are upon the Spot to keep their Eyes and ears equally open, to penetrate as much as can be into the Miſeries of the City of <hi>Turin,</hi> and to hearken to the Propoſitions that the Prince will make to them; which as ſoon as we are acquainted with, they will know the King's pleaſure.</p>
               <p>If Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> has a good Intention, the Extremity to which he is reduc'd, and the Incapacity the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have been in to aſſiſt him, diſcharge him ſufficiently, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and Men, without his being oblig'd to uſe any other pretence to quit their Party.</p>
               <p>His Father and his Brother's Prudence has made them do the ſame out of reaſon, with leſs cauſe: And when he ſeems to require nothing but an apparent reaſon to retire, he only endeavours to conceal his Ill Will; which is the more evident, in that he is unwilling to believe he has a lawful cauſe to withdraw from the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> unleſs he ſettles his affairs on the ruins of the Dutcheſs, and of her Son, as he would do for his own advantage.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> not having been able to ſuccour him, he may honourably take the party of <hi>France,</hi> and of his own Nephew; the King declaring, that he only keeps the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he is in poſſeſſion of, for his ſaid Nephew, and for
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42519:297"/>
himſelf in caſe the Succeſſion thereof ſhould lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve to him; and that he will moſt certainly deliver them into his ſaid Nephew's hands whenever he ſhall be of Age, and in a condition to preſerve them; or to the Cardinal, his Brother; or to himſelf, in caſe that young Prince ſhould chance to die; he has all the reaſon in the world to be ſatisfy'd.</p>
               <p>In caſe His Majeſty ſhould likewiſe think ſit to reſtore his Penſions to him, to give one to his Son, and one to the Princeſs of <hi>Carignan,</hi> and to intreat the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to add to the Portion of the ſaid Prince; if, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he ſhould be willing to employ him in ſome of his Armies; things that may be done, and that may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him; he will not only find with the King all the means that are neceſſary to quit the Engagement he is in with Honour, but alſo all the uſeful ones he can reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably deſire.</p>
               <p>In caſe he ſhould alſo require an immediate Propoſition to be made by the King, to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the places they are in poſſeſſion of in <hi>Piedmont</hi> ſince the late War, on condition that His Majeſty will do the ſame; Anſwer muſt be made, That the King agrees to this Article, and will make his Declaration of it after the Treaty; deſiring nothing more, than to find the means to ſecure all the Gariſons to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> in ſuch a manner as no Inconveniencies may ariſe thereby. But that whereas Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> ſays, he had rather die, than make a Treaty by which his Honour might be wounded; ſo likewiſe the King can no wiſe conſent to have that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle put into the Treaty, of the Surrender of <hi>Turin,</hi> ſince it would look as if the ſaid City were rather yielded to him on that Conſideration, than by the Force of his Arms.</p>
               <p>The Declaration the King will make on that Account, is a ſufficient Security to ſatisfie the Princes, without being oblig'd to have Recourſe to the Interpoſition of the Pope, and of the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, the King may do an equivalent thing, writing to His Holineſs, and to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages for the Reſtauration of the ſaid places, on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions above ſpecify'd.</p>
               <p>The King moreover condeſcends, that the Pope and the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould interpoſe in the ſaid Treaty after its being made, if they will engage to take Arms for the King in caſe the Princes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> or one of them, breaking their Word, ſhould return to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſide.</p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:42519:298"/>
               <p>Beſides, If they ſhould require <hi>Nice</hi> to be put into the Cardinal's Hands for the ſpace of ſix Months, during which the ſaid Interpoſition may be manag'd, it ſhall be granted, provided, as ſoon as ever the Treaty is made, they put <hi>Coni</hi> into the hands of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> again, and that Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> engages himſelf into the Party of <hi>France,</hi> and comes actually to ſerve there upon the Account of the good Treatment that is offer'd to him, and of all the Securities in writing, he can deſire from the King, for the Performance thereof.</p>
               <p>In caſe the ſaid Prince ſays, That before his coming into <hi>France,</hi> he muſt contrive to get his Wife and Children out of <hi>Spain</hi> by Cunning; it is another Blind, to conceal his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of remaining in the Intereſt of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, If the lawful Cauſes he has to quit the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> cannot oblige him to do it openly, one muſt be blind not to ſee that he perſiſts in the Reſolution to ruin his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew; and that his Animoſities againſt <hi>France,</hi> becauſe it is the only Power that can maintain him, is unſpeakable: And if it be in his Nature to ſuffer his Nephew's Reign, he has but too much cauſe to forſake the party of thoſe that ſeek his ruin, for the ill Treatments he has receiv'd from them, and more than enough to ſide with <hi>France,</hi> that will ſave him, for the advantages they offer him.</p>
               <p>This is all that can be ſaid at this time to Count <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court:</hi> Whereupon, he is to take his Meaſures according to his Inſtruction of the 28th of <hi>May,</hi> and this preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch.

               <p>IMmediately after having ſeen the Diſpatch of Monſieur <hi>du Hallier,</hi> and the Credentials of the Sieur <hi>Vitelle</hi> from the Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> this Gentleman is ſent to him with all ſpeed, to acquaint him with the King's Intentions.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty is very willing that the Sieur <hi>de la Grange-aux-Ormes</hi> ſhould no longer be concern'd in this Affair, having only ſent him to the Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> becauſe he himſelf had deſir'd it; which is juſtify'd by a Letter of his.</p>
               <p>The King approves <hi>du Hallier</hi>'s proceeding, in giving a Paſs to the Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> to go to, and tarry in ſafety at <hi>St. Avan;</hi> His Majeſty ſuppoſing his Intention to be good, and that he will treat ſincerely, is willing that the Sieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> ſhould give him a freſh Security, the moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in the beſt Form that can be made, to abide at <hi>Eſpinal,</hi> or <hi>Remiremont,</hi> in order to make his Treaty with more Convenience.</p>
               <p>And whereas he is deſirous a Commiſſion ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to adjuſt it, to ſome Perſon of Quality, on whom the King repoſes a Confidence, His Majeſty has caſt his Eyes upon the ſaid Sieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> to that end; aſſuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he will diſcharge his Truſt with all the Addreſs and Prudence requir'd.</p>
               <p>Such a Treaty as the King can make, is ſent to the ſaid <hi>du Hallier;</hi> he muſt endeavour to make Duke <hi>Charles</hi> agree to it, without Modification; and however, is to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it in ſuch a manner as may not diſguſt him: And if he finds that he cannot abſolutely prevail with him to accept it, by diſputing the Articles, he muſt, if poſſible, oblige the ſaid Duke to demand the things mention'd in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications, in order to conclude it the ſooner, and that there may be the leſs difficulty when the ſaid Duke ſhall be poſſeſs'd that thoſe things are granted to him which he deſires.</p>

               <p>The Firſt, in leaving him the Country of <hi>Bar,</hi> not to deprive him of his Revenue: Which Monſieur <hi>du Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> is to make him ſenſible of, as of a great and ſingular Favour.</p>

               <p>The Second, In ſhortning the Depoſition of <hi>Nancy</hi> into the King's hands, for the term of three Years after the Peace.</p>
               <p>If he ſhould require the Price of the County of <hi>Clermont,</hi> as it was ſtipulated by the Treaty made with him before the War, it muſt be repreſented to him, That having put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the Bounds of that Treaty, by the Breach he made with the King, he can no longer require the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. That the War has alter'd all things; and that he ought to look upon it as a great Favour, that the King ſhould return him what he is willing to reſtore, without asking for more.</p>
               <p>He muſt add to this, That if the King ſhould demand the Charges of the War, in returning his Country to him, which he might lawfully do, and is generally done, they would amount to more than the Price of the State it ſelf.</p>
               <p>In caſe the ſaid Duke ſhould demand a Strong Hold for the place of his Reſidence, it muſt be repreſented to him, That the King neither can, nor ought in reaſon to hearken to ſuch a Propoſition, ſince it would be a means to enable him anew to revolt againſt His Majeſty, in caſe he were minded ſo to do; for then the King could have no Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty beyond his Word, which he cannot look upon as invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, but by a long Experience, conſidering what is paſt.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, if he ſhould inſiſt very much upon having <hi>la Motte,</hi> the only place to the Reſtitution of which His Majeſty could conſent, Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> may give him his Choice, to have the ſaid Town again after the War, if he will conſent, by the preſent Treaty, to leave the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Bar</hi> in propriety to the King.</p>
               <p>In that Caſe, the Fourth Article, about the Country of <hi>Bar,</hi> muſt remain as it is ſet down in the Treaty, putting <hi>la Motte</hi> out of the beginning of the Fifth Article, of the places that are to remain in the King's hands; adding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe Words of the Seventh Article, <hi>Unleſs the ſaid Duke had rather tarry for the Reſtitution of the ſaid Places till after the Settlement of a general Peace,</hi> that which follows, <hi>Which is particularly agreed upon about the Town of</hi> La Motte, <hi>which His Majeſty is willing to reſtore to the ſaid Duke, in order one day to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſafely in the ſame; but that is only to be deliver'd to him three Years after the Concluſion of the Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> is not to acquaint the Duke with the Particulars of this Treaty by the Interpoſition of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but by Word of Mouth; ſince it will be much eaſier for him to prevail with the ſaid Duke perſonally, than by
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42519:300"/>
the Interpoſition of any one whatever. And though the ſaid Duke ſhould ſwear and proteſt not to paſs certain things, Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> is not to deſiſt for that; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid Duke's Cuſtom to return from one Extremity to another, whatever Proteſtation he has made to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>It is thought neceſſary to chuſe a Newter Place to paſs this Treaty, as <hi>Remiremont,</hi> or <hi>Eſpinal,</hi> or ſome adjacent place in the Country, where Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> is to take care not to go without Safety.</p>
               <p>In order to ſatisfie all the World of the Truth of this Treaty, when it is made, the ſaid Duke is to come to the King. However, in caſe he ſhould refuſe to do it ſo ſoon, Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> is not to break off with him for that. But I am confident that he will make no difficulty about it, upon the Faith of the Treaty, and the Paſs that is ſent him; together with all the Aſſurances Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> is to give him, that he will be ſerv'd and aſſiſted at Court by <hi>my Lord the Cardinal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the ſaid Duke repreſents the extream Neceſſity to which he is reduc'd, Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> may grant him 50000 Crowns once paid; which he will receive when he comes to wait upon the King.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> is to make no difficulty of promiſing that the Fault committed by <hi>de Ville,</hi> in making his Eſcape, contrary to his Faith, will be pardon'd by the King; and that he will look upon him, as if it had never happen'd.</p>
               <p>His Eminency writes a Letter to Monſieur <hi>du Hallier,</hi> in order to his ſhewing it to the Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> as from himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Treaty muſt be deliver'd to Monſieur <hi>du Hallier,</hi> counter-ſign'd by the Duke's Secretary officiating at this time, and ſeal'd with his Seal.</p>

               <p>THE little Truſt that can be repos'd in the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> makes it very difficult to make any Treaty with him, without running the hazard of being deceiv'd in it.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:42519:301"/>
               <p>This Conſideration will oblige Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> to take a particular Care to follow all the Expreſſions of the Treaty that is ſent to him moſt religiouſly, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any Alterations, becauſe this Prince is captious, and that it is certainly known that he has not the Intentions he ought to have.</p>
               <p>It is moreover known, that he has given an Account of the Overtures of the Treaty he is about, to the Cardinal Infant; ſaying, That he is courted to it againſt his Will; and that far greater Offers are made him, than the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the King is willing to grant him.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Duke has alſo communicated this Treaty to all the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and particularly to thoſe of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> and <hi>Cologne,</hi> with the ſame Suppoſitions he has ſent into <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be proper to let him know that we are acquainted with all his Artifices and Levities; and that ſuch a manner of proceeding does almoſt break off all manner of Treaty, ſince he has nothing on his ſide to give the King, but his Fidelity, which he does not approve.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, in order to give Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> means to conclude a Treaty, if there be any hopes to make a good one, the King has been pleas'd once more to anſwer the three new Demands made by <hi>Videl,</hi> in the Duke <hi>Charles</hi>'s Name; and to give the ſaid <hi>du Hallier</hi> means to ſatisfie the ſaid Duke, if he be capable of acknowledging a Courteſie; which he grants him, beyond what he could expect in Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Duke demands the Title of Sovereign in the Treaty: That a Gariſon may be given him immediately in <hi>Lorrain:</hi> And that thoſe Gariſons the King is to keep in the places that are to remain in his poſſeſſion may not be paid out of the Revenues of <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is thought, that by the firſt of theſe three Demands, Duke <hi>Charles</hi> intends to oblige the King to decide the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> Law, pretended in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> in favour of him; which His Majeſty cannot do, without enquiring farther into the matter; eſpecially, with a Perſon who is not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with him.

               <p>As to the Gariſon he deſires, were the King perſuaded that he had a mind to treat ſincerely, he would condeſcend to it; but it is impoſſible to reſolve on it, without that Aſſurance: 'Tis the ſaid Duke's part to give us ſuch an one.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion that ſuch an one might be had, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certing a Clauſe in the Treaty, by which the Duke may ſhew that he is willing to deprive himſelf of the Means of failing.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Clauſe ought to be as followeth:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>As to the City of</hi> La Motte, <hi>His Majeſty being mov'd by the earneſt Intreaty the ſaid Duke has made to him, to have the ſaid City deliver'd into his hands, in order to his being the better able to execute what he promiſes by the preſent Treaty, ſince it will put him in a Condition not to fear thoſe, whoſe Ill Will he will incur by making this Engagement, His ſaid Majeſty has been pleas'd to grant it; the ſaid Duke conſenting freely, that in caſe he ſhould make an ill Uſe of this Advantage, by violating the preſent Treaty, (which he will be the better able to execute, having a ſafe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,) His Majeſty ſhould make him reſent the Effects of his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, attacking his Territories anew, and preſerving to Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity whatever he ſhall take there by Force of Arms.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Though this Clauſe ſeems to give ſome Aſſurance, the Experience of what is paſt, which has ſhewn that nothing can hinder the ſaid Duke <hi>Charles</hi> from following his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions when-ever he is mov'd by them, makes us ſenſible that this Pre-caution is not ſufficient to venture to put a ſtrong Place into the hands of a Prince, who may chance to do a great deal of Miſchief with it during the War.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, If, after having ſeen the ſaid Duke, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> thinks that there is more Sincerity in his proceeding than before, His Majeſty will run that hazard, to promote a Peace.</p>
               <p>As to the Payment of the Gariſons, the King reſtoring the ſaid Duke to the Poſſeſſion of his Territories, out of his extraordinary Goodneſs, His Majeſty has no Thoughts of reſerving any thing to himſelf there, beſides the places mention'd in the ſaid Treaty, with the Liberties thereof; inſomuch that in caſe the ſaid Duke immediately paſſes the Treaty, coming between this and the Month of <hi>January,</hi> to pay his Reſpects to the King, he ſhall begin to enjoy his Territories on the very beginning of the next Year.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:42519:302"/>
               <p>It will be Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi>'s part to decide the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſaid Towns very advantageouſly for the King.</p>
               <p>There will be no need of mentioning the Liberties of <hi>Clermont,</hi> ſince the County is to remain in the King's Hands, as well as the Town.</p>
               <p>The King deſires the ſaid <hi>du Hallier</hi> to cauſe a Map to be made of all the Country round about the ſaid Places, in which the Liberties of the ſame are to be particularly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according as he ſhall think they ought to be, and ſo ſend the ſame to His Majeſty, who will acquaint him with his Pleaſure therein.</p>
               <p>Thus Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> may acquaint the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> That in treating with him, he will treat as with a Sovereign; and that he does not doubt, in caſe the ſaid Duke behaves himſelf towards His Majeſty as he ought to do, that he will pay the Gariſons of the Towns that are to remain in his hands. In a word, That he is perſuaded, that when he ſees him, if he knows how to deſerve His Majeſty's Favour, he will be able to give him Satisfaction: But that he cannot explain himſelf farther, without having ſeen the Diſpoſition he is in, and known the Security he is willing to give His Majeſty of his Fidelity. Moreover, Whenever the ſaid <hi>du Hallier</hi> ſees the Duke, it will ſuit with his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to behave himſelf in ſuch a manner, that in caſe the ſaid Duke be not in a Condition to perform his Duty freely towards the King, he may not be able to ſay, That he has been willing to reſtore <hi>La Motte</hi> to him immediately.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> is to let him make the Propoſition about it, ſaying, that he has no Order to grant it, and that he does not believe the King will do it; but that he will propoſe it to His Majeſty: And if he finds all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on excepting that Point, he is to promiſe to give him an Anſwer in ſeven or eight Days time; and to diſpatch a Courier to <hi>St. Germain,</hi> where the King will be.</p>

               <p>THE divers Circumſtances of Duke <hi>Charles</hi>'s proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who ſends to Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> upon a ſlight Pretence, being join'd to the Advice we have of an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt he makes upon <hi>Nancy,</hi> ſhew clearly, that the firſt End of the ſeveral Journeys and Meſſages he ſends to Monſieur <hi>du Hallier,</hi> is his Enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to know whether the ſaid Duke intends to treat freely with the King, in caſe his Enterprize ſhould fail: But it is certain that he will never come to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of any Treaty while that is on foot, by reaſon that the Succeſs of ſuch a Deſign is, in his Imagination, much more advantageous than any Treaty he can make.</p>
               <p>Upon this Foundation, which is to be held infallible, in my Opinion, the firſt thing to be done, is, to break the ſaid Duke's Deſign upon <hi>Nancy:</hi> Which may be done two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ways:</p>
               <p>The Firſt is, By diſcovering the ſaid Enterpriſe, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and by puniſhing thoſe ſeverely, who ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of having a hand in the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Second is, In caſe we cannot diſcover the particular Circumſtances of the Treaſon that is projected, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> muſt plainly acquaint the ſaid Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> that he knows his Deſign, that he ought to be aſham'd to anſwer the King's good Will towards him by ſuch an Action as that he is projecting: That having ſuch a Deſign, he deſires him no longer to ſend any body towards him, nor any longer to harbour any Thoughts, out of Gratitude for the Zeal he had to ſerve him in the King's Service, to make him forfeit his Life and Honour.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> is to baniſh from <hi>Nancy</hi> all ſuſpected Perſons, without ſparing Women, by whoſe Means one may often inſinuate ones ſelf into Men's Minds; and to remove out of the Gariſon all ſuch as he is any wiſe jealous of; and finally, to provide againſt the Duke's evil Deſigns, by all manner of Means.</p>
               <p>This Proceeding will be ſo far from ſpoiling any thing, that, on the contrary, if the Duke has a Mind to treat, it
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42519:303"/>
will put him in a way to do it; and if he intends no ſuch thing, it will ſoon appear.</p>
               <p>If he has a real Intention to agree in caſe his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe fails, the Diſcovery that will be made to him by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>du Hallier,</hi> of his evil Projects, will not hinder him from proſecuting the good ones; <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Nothing hinders a Man from purſuing his Good, when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects a good Succeſs by his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations. You muſt be careful to diſcover whether the ſaid D.</hi> Charles <hi>has any Forces within ten Leagues of</hi> Nancy, <hi>which he might aſſemble on a ſudden. You muſt know where Monſicur</hi> de Ville <hi>is.</hi>
                  </note> and if he makes no farther Inſtance about it, it will be a manifeſt Sign that he had nothing but Treaſon in his Mind.</p>
               <p>Therefore I am of Opinion, that nothing can be better than to act as aboveſaid. After which, it will behove Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> to have a ſtrict Eye over Duke <hi>Charles</hi>'s A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and thoſe of his Adherents.</p>
               <p>As to the Treaty, I think there will be no need to break the Courſe of it, in caſe the Duke has a Mind to continue it after what ſhall be written to him; and for the preſent, I do not ſee that any thing can be done in the ſame, but to remain <hi>in deliberatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, I am of Opinion that it will not be amiſs to acquaint the Dutcheſs of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that the Duke has made new Applications to the King upon that Subject, in order thereby to put her in a Way to enter on ſome good Overture, if ſhe be capable of it; as the Words ſhe has ſent by Monſieur <hi>de Chanvalou</hi> ſeem to inſinuate that ſhe deſigns.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>du Hallier</hi> is in no wiſe to ſuffer any Stranger to come into the Town, unleſs he be known to him; and much leſs any one belonging to the Duke <hi>Charles.</hi> This is the King's Pleaſure.</p>
